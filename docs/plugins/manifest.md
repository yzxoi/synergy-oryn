# Generated Plugin Manifest

`dist/plugin.json` is a pure-data build artifact. `definePlugin()` is its only source. Authors must not edit or maintain a source manifest.

## Top-Level Shape

```jsonc
{
  "manifestVersion": 1,
  "apiVersion": "4.0",
  "compatibility": { "synergy": ">=3.0.23" },
  "id": "my-plugin",
  "name": "My Plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Example",
  "capabilities": [{ "id": "workspace.read" }],
  "contributions": [],
  "artifacts": {
    "generation": "content-derived-generation",
    "runtime": { "entry": "runtime/index.js", "sha256": "..." },
    "ui": { "apiVersion": "5.0", "entry": "ui/index.js", "sha256": "...", "resources": [] },
  },
}
```

Identity, compatibility, and descriptive fields come from `definePlugin()`. `compatibility.synergy` is a semver range for the oldest host that implements every stable API4 feature used by that plugin; `definePlugin()` defaults it to the first GA API4 host. Raise the minimum only when adopting a later additive feature. `capabilities` is the approved ceiling for Synergy Host Services. `contributions` is the handler-free form of the flat source list. `artifacts` and `generation` come from the build.

`apiVersion: "4.0"` identifies the entire stable API4 family. The npm authoring packages follow the Synergy product release version, so their package major does not select the Plugin API family. Synergy reads `apiVersion` and `compatibility` before strict V4 decoding and before executable import. Early pre-GA API4 artifacts that omitted `compatibility` receive the API4 base range at the decoder boundary.

UI artifacts declare their independent API version and explicit resource path/hash graph. Plugin Kit raises the generated minimum host version for UI API 5; a backend-only plugin retains the API4 baseline. A missing UI version identifies UI4 metadata, which can still be inspected but cannot execute in the UI5 host. See [UI contributions](ui-contributions.md).

Contribution IDs are unique within a contribution kind. This permits a command operation and its declarative UI action to share one meaningful local ID while their kind-qualified identities remain distinct. Every `requires` entry must name a top-level capability. Executable declarations require a runtime artifact. A trusted component requires a UI artifact.

## Schemas and Handlers

Source contributions may use Zod or JSON Schema. Build converts Zod to JSON Schema and removes handlers from the manifest. Tool input must compile to a top-level JSON Schema object. The generated object schema is canonical metadata: AJV-backed runtime validation does not round-trip it through Zod. Runtime startup reports protocol version, generation, and actual handler IDs. The host rejects missing, undeclared, or duplicate handlers.

Tools and MCP servers may declare a settings condition:

```ts
tool({
  id: "inspect",
  enabledWhen: { setting: "diagnosticsEnabled", equals: true },
  input: InspectInput,
  handler,
})

mcp({
  id: "components",
  enabledWhen: { setting: "componentsEnabled", equals: true },
  server: { type: "local", command: ["frontend-mcp"], startup: "eager" },
})
```

The referenced key must exist in the plugin's `ui.settings` object schema. Schema defaults apply before a value is stored. The current Scope filters gated tools during resolution and checks them again at dispatch; settings changes atomically replace the plugin's complete MCP server set.

Multi-resource panels may define the resource opened by default:

```ts
workbenchPanel({
  id: "research",
  cardinality: "multi",
  defaultResource: { id: "map", title: "Research map", state: { view: "map" } },
  component: { source: "./src/ui/research.tsx" },
})
```

## Integrity

Every runtime and UI artifact has a SHA-256 hash in the manifest. `integrity.json` covers the generated manifest and packaged files. Synergy validates metadata, paths, and hashes before importing runtime code. Absolute paths, escaping `..` paths, missing declared assets, and tampered artifacts are rejected.

`ui.theme.path` must reference a packaged `.json` file accepted by the shared Synergy theme schema. `ui.icon.path` references a packaged SVG. Both are data contributions: they do not require a trusted component bundle.

The generated manifest does not contain dependency-install instructions, a duplicate permission tree, a runtime descriptor, or a hand-maintained contribution map.
