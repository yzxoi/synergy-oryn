# Plugin Getting Started

## Create a Project

Use Bun and the plugin kit:

```bash
bunx @ericsanchezok/synergy-plugin-kit create my-plugin --template workbench-panel
cd my-plugin
bun install
```

Available templates are `tool-ui`, `workbench-panel`, `navigation`, `api-connector`, and `theme-icon`.

The generated project exports one definition from `src/index.ts`:

```ts
import z from "zod"
import { capability, definePlugin, event, operation, workbenchPanel } from "@ericsanchezok/synergy-plugin"

export default definePlugin({
  id: "my-plugin",
  version: "0.1.0",
  description: "My Synergy plugin",
  assets: [{ source: "src/prompts", target: "runtime/prompts" }],
  capabilities: [capability("workspace.read"), capability("ui.hostActions")],
  contributions: [
    event({ id: "data.changed", payload: z.object({ reason: z.string() }) }),
    operation({
      id: "data.get",
      type: "query",
      input: z.object({}),
      output: z.object({ value: z.string() }),
      requires: ["workspace.read"],
      async handler(_input, context) {
        return { value: (await context.workspace?.read?.("data.txt")) ?? "" }
      },
    }),
    workbenchPanel({
      id: "main",
      label: "My Plugin",
      surface: "side",
      cardinality: "singleton",
      component: { source: "./src/ui.tsx" },
    }),
  ],
})
```

Do not create `plugin.json` in the source project. Validation rejects it.

## Build and Validate

```bash
synergy-plugin build
synergy-plugin validate --runtime-discovery
synergy-plugin test
synergy-plugin pack
```

`build` recreates `dist/`, bundles executable handlers, compiles trusted Solid UI, copies declared assets, and writes generated metadata and integrity hashes. `validate --runtime-discovery` imports the packaged runtime only in the explicit validation step and checks that its handler IDs exactly match generated executable contributions. `pack` archives the already-built `dist/`; it never installs dependencies at install time.

Use top-level `assets` for files that executable code needs at runtime. Each entry maps a project-relative `source` file or directory to a package-relative `target`. Targets must be unique and remain inside the package. Asset contents are covered by `integrity.json` and participate in the build generation, so changing a prompt, schema, or other runtime resource creates a new generation. Do not rely on source-tree-relative paths from a bundled runtime.

The package contains:

```text
plugin.json
integrity.json
permissions.summary.json
runtime/index.js   # only when executable code exists
ui/index.js        # only when trusted components exist
declared assets
```

## Register a Local Directory

Build first, then register the project or its `dist` directory:

```bash
synergy plugin add file:///absolute/path/to/my-plugin
```

For a directory spec, Synergy uses `dist/plugin.json` when it exists. The Plugins workspace shows the registration under both **Installed** and **Development**. A local registry package is different: it is a catalog artifact and appears under **Discover** when the Local registry source is selected.

If the generated manifest or permissions have not been approved, the plugin remains disabled as `Needs approval`. Review the server-generated permissions and approve with:

```bash
synergy plugin approve my-plugin
```

Approval records are tied to publisher identity and the structured access grant. Metadata, code, handler, asset, and changelog-only rebuilds keep the existing grant. Removing access or narrowing known constraints updates silently. New Host Services, broader constraints, trusted UI, broader operation exposure, or an unknown constraint change require confirmation of only the added/broadened access. A source or signer change requires publisher confirmation.

## Live Development

For a complete isolated host, run:

```bash
synergy-plugin preview
```

Open the printed URL, approve the built plugin in Plugins, and select a Shell or Skin in General settings if needed. Preview runs the production App with a temporary home and its own port. It watches compiled dependencies and declared resources; restart it after capability changes to review the new grant. `synergy-plugin typegen` generates typed operation/event declarations. The public `@ericsanchezok/synergy-plugin-kit/testing` entry provides preview and browser helpers for authors' tests.

Use an isolated Synergy instance with an explicit `SYNERGY_HOME`, then run:

```bash
synergy-plugin dev --server-url http://127.0.0.1:PORT
```

The watcher builds into generation directories under `dist/dev/`. A successful build updates the generation pointer and asks the isolated server to reload atomically. A failed build leaves the previous generation active. Live reload refuses to contact a server unless `SYNERGY_HOME` is explicitly set. Dev generation hot reload is separate from approval, config schema, and migration behavior.

## Publish

Sign the built package and prepare a marketplace entry:

```bash
synergy-plugin sign my-plugin-0.1.0.synergy-plugin.tgz
synergy-plugin publish-market --repo https://github.com/owner/my-plugin
```

Publishing is an explicit command. Build, validate, test, and pack never mutate a remote registry. See [Marketplace](marketplace.md).

The [functional example](../../packages/plugin-kit/test/fixtures/ui5-functional/README.md) and [workbench example](../../packages/plugin-kit/test/fixtures/ui5-workbench/README.md) are complete buildable author projects. The repository's `bun run plugin-ui:test` verifies their packed artifacts against the production host. For a local performance comparison, build the App in both checkouts, then run `bun test/plugin-ui5/benchmark.ts <baseline-checkout> <output.json>` from the updated checkout. The benchmark uses isolated homes and reports three trials of startup resources, session navigation, 60 message-part updates, bounded rows and first plugin navigation; it never uses a configured model provider.
