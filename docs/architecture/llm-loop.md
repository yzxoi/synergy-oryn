# LLM Loop and Compaction

## Purpose

The session LLM loop turns one root task into an ordered sequence of model calls, tool executions, injected context, and persisted assistant messages. It continues until the task has a terminal assistant reply, the user aborts, a blocking loop job stops it, or an unrecoverable error is persisted.

The loop is not an in-memory conversation object. Durable messages and session state remain authoritative; the runtime is a single-writer execution window over that state.

## Entry and Ownership

New direct input is either materialized as a root user message or queued in `SessionInbox`. When a reply is required, the session records `pendingReply` and enters `SessionManager.run()`.

`SessionManager.run()` acquires a generation-tagged lease synchronously, before session lookup or workspace setup can yield. The lease is the loop's owner identity and carries its abort signal. Its runtime phase moves from `starting` to `running`; cancellation moves it to `stopping` without clearing ownership. Only the exact owner lease can complete waiters or release the runtime, so a stale loop cannot abort, complete, or release a newer owner. Other callers attach waiters to the occupied runtime.

During ownership:

- the lease abort signal is shared by the session run;
- status changes are published as busy, retry, idle, or recovering;
- the loop-scoped message cache holds the compaction-aware model working set;
- all loop writes update that cache and durable storage;
- cache and recall state are released when the loop exits.

The message cache is valid because the active loop is the sole session writer. On a cold read, history loading scans ordered message info, applies rollback events, finds the latest committed compaction boundary, and loads parts only for the boundary root, retained summaries, and active suffix. Completed compaction reprojects the cache immediately so pre-boundary parts are released. Structural changes that incremental maintenance cannot model invalidate the cache and force an authoritative working-set reread; full transcript paths remain disk-backed. The process-wide cache byte budget is also a hard ceiling for each session entry: an oversized working set remains disk-backed instead of defeating aggregate eviction.

The cache maintains bounded operational accounting for its estimated retained bytes, active and total entries, largest entries, hits, misses, evictions, and occasions where active protected entries keep it over budget. Entry estimates walk the cached immutable message graph without first materializing a second serialized transcript. Public Performance read models omit Session IDs and expose only aggregate counts and entry sizes.

## Root Selection

Each outer iteration loads effective, canonicalized session history and finds the latest root user message `R`.

`R` owns:

- task identity and `rootID`
- model, agent, variant, system override, and per-message tool mask
- the compaction anchor
- assistant `parentID` and `rootID`

The loop never chooses a Cortex notification, workflow continuation, or other non-root message as the task owner.

A root message's model and variant belong to that durable root execution and remain stable for its continuation and tool loop. Steer and `noReply` messages do not own an execution variant. Each new root independently resolves its model and then its variant; QuickSwitch or `modelOverride` changes apply to the next root. Non-small root execution remains strict for unavailable persisted variants.

## Inbox Drain Order

For root `R`, each inner iteration follows two inbox gates:

1. `steer` items are materialized before `needsModelCall`. A steer can wake or extend the active task.
2. If a model call is required, `context` items are materialized so they piggyback on that call. Context alone never creates a call.

After the inner task loop ends, the outer loop takes the next `task` item and materializes it as a new root. If no task remains but a runnable steer exists for a prior root, the loop re-enters that root.

This order is the scheduling contract. Delivery sources must choose the correct inbox mode rather than encoding scheduling through metadata.

## Per-Step Flow

One model step performs the following work:

1. Load the session, effective messages, root parts, last terminal assistant, and current model limits.
2. Detect loop signals and run pre-LLM jobs.
3. Resolve the root agent and model, including external-agent routing where configured.
4. Resolve tool definitions, system context, Cortex context, Library recall, environment context, and Agenda reminders in parallel where independent.
5. Project workflow-wrapped messages without mutating stored user text.
6. Build and measure the provider prompt.
7. Trigger compaction instead of calling the model if the prompt crosses the configured soft budget or leaves no response space.
8. Resolve a serializable model-facing tool catalog separately from Control Plane execution callbacks.
9. Queue the provider turn on `AgentTurn`, consume its bounded event frames, and persist one assistant message.
10. Release the Agent worker, dispatch generation-aware ToolTasks, authorize each operation in the Control Plane before physical execution, and settle results.
11. Run post-LLM jobs, persist terminal state, and decide whether another model call is needed.

The assistant created for the step keeps `parentID = R.id` and `rootID = R.id`, even when the step follows a steer, context injection, tool result, or compaction boundary.

Release-triggered memory work never blocks the Linux turn settlement path. Turn and tool releases enqueue one coalesced signal; the Control Plane classifies its process memory separately from service-wide cgroup pressure. Service-only pressure never requests Control Plane GC. Only critical memory attributed to the Control Plane can request synchronous full GC, and only after the provider stream is disposed and the full-GC cooldown has elapsed. Agent and tool-process memory is recovered by those process owners rather than by collecting the HTTP/WebSocket process.

## Agent and Model Resolution

Root messages persist the resolved agent and model used to start their task. Session-level explicit overrides can become defaults for later roots, while lower-priority fallback resolution does not write back into a user's draft selection.

The Web composer uses the same intent layering:

1. current user draft selection
2. session default: server `modelOverride`, otherwise the last root message
3. application fallback

An explicit selector choice persists as `modelOverride`. Provider authentication remains provider-specific; the `openai-codex` native Codex path does not receive the normal OpenAI API-key/base-URL override.

### Model variants and reasoning options

Model capability metadata from catalogs such as models.dev describes what a model advertises, but it does not prove that a service reusing another provider's AI SDK package accepts the same provider option semantics. Automatic reasoning variants are derived from model identity (`model.id`, API model ID, or model family) combined with the direct transport. They are not selected from provider IDs, and a shared npm package alone does not establish option compatibility, so custom provider aliases retain correct behavior.

`ProviderTransform.variants()` applies transport-specific rules for third-party services on Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible wiring. Kimi K3 models on direct Anthropic transport expose catalog-declared `low`, `high`, and `max` variants. `low` and `high` map to Anthropic `effort`; `max` omits `effort` because Kimi's service default is already `max` and the locked Anthropic SDK accepts only `low`, `medium`, or `high`. Selecting no variant likewise uses Kimi's server-side `max` default. Kimi K2.x models remain provider-managed. Native Anthropic models are gated by thinking generation: 4.7+ (and 5.x) expose adaptive `low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max` variants (`thinking.type: "adaptive"` with `display: "summarized"` plus `effort`, because these models reject `enabled + budget_tokens` with HTTP 400), 4.6 models expose adaptive `low`/`medium`/`high`/`max` (budget still works but is deprecated), and 3.x-4.5 models expose budget variants `high`/`max` derived from the effective output cap (`high = min(16_000, floor(cap/2 - 1))`, `max = min(31_999, cap - 1_024)`), each guaranteed to keep at least 1_024 tokens of visible-answer room and to stay below the cap. Catalog effort declarations are trusted only for unknown/unversioned ids and Opus 4.5 (the sole extended-only model that also supports effort); recognizable earlier generations stay on budgets.

When a third-party transport case returns no automatic variants, a configured `role_variant` such as `max` is applied only if the resolved model exposes a same-named variant; otherwise the provider receives no generated option and uses its server-side reasoning default. User-defined model `variants` are merged after automatic defaults and can add or override named variants for individual models.

A sessionless or internal lightweight call may reuse a source root user envelope for context and attribution, but `small: true` never consumes that envelope's durable variant. `SessionRootVariant.options()` returns `{}` before variant validation, so target-model options come from `ProviderTransform.smallOptions()` even when the source and target models match. Non-small root execution continues to validate and apply its persisted variant.

## Internal LLM Invocation Paths

Not every model call belongs to a persisted conversation, but every product inference must use a deliberate lifecycle boundary.

| Lifecycle                      | Current boundary                                                                             | Examples and properties                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sessionless derived work       | `AgentCall.text()` through the external worker pool, with separate rollout call records      | title and turn summaries, activity summaries, SmartAllow, agent generation, and Experience encoding; no resumable transcript, Cortex progress, or completion notice |
| Existing durable work          | `SessionInvoke` and the owning session loop, with each provider turn executed by `AgentTurn` | user/API input, Channel or Agenda execution, workflow continuation, and in-place compaction                                                                         |
| New delegated or reviewed work | `Cortex.launch()`                                                                            | a child session with lineage, visibility, concurrency, progress, cancellation, timeout, cleanup, and a summary/final/structured output contract                     |
| Provider/bootstrap probe       | a narrow direct AI SDK call                                                                  | setup capability probing before the normal agent/session runtime is available                                                                                       |

`AgentCall.text()` is the Core boundary for text-only Sessionless work. It resolves the Agent and model (with an explicit caller-owned fallback), uses a Scope operation identity when no session identity exists, fixes the model-facing tool catalog to empty, combines caller cancellation, timeout, and output-limit aborts, queues the call through `AgentTurn` in the external worker pool, collects an owned text stream within a bound, and disposes it in `finally`. It returns structured missing-agent/model, timeout, cancellation, and input/output-bound errors. It never creates Session history, Cortex work, Experience lineage, or completion notices. The caller continues to own prompts, retry count, fallback policy, parsing, persistence, and domain error mapping.

`AgentTurn` commits call intent and the semantic request before starting the stream. It archives consumed SDK events and terminal SDK usage in the Control Plane, under the owning session or Scope operation. Recording failures stop stream consumption and signal the owning session to abort. They also seal the run against subsequent calls: the ledger persists failed recording state and retains an in-process admission guard if that marker cannot be written. Restoring storage does not silently reopen the failed run, and its completion cannot be reported as successful. Independent operation records do not create synthetic sessions.

Built-in provider fetch paths capture actual inference attempts after request rewriting and inside authentication-recovery retries. `RolloutTransport` records request and response bytes without authentication headers, cookies, or URL query credentials. Response headers use an explicit allowlist. Body chunks coalesce up to 256 KiB or a 25 ms window; archival acknowledgements follow durable Control Plane checkpoints. The worker has one unacknowledged archive frame at a time, separate from model-event flow control. Cancellation preserves committed prefixes, and stream disposal waits for worker release and outstanding archival writes. A call marks transport capture complete only when it observed attempts and all their request and response artifacts completed; SDK events alone cannot establish that status. Codex remote compaction uses the same call ledger under its source root task, with a Control Plane transport context. Its local and remote tracks run concurrently, but the compaction job awaits both tracks and durable attachment before completing. Failed local attempts cancel and drain the remote request; recording errors propagate instead of becoming optional metadata failures. Sessionless bootstrap and other non-chat operations still require their explicit lifecycle binding.

Title and turn summary generation, activity summaries, SmartAllow, agent generation, and Experience Encoder all enter the same Core boundary through `AgentCall.text()`. Domain-specific callers keep their prompt, parsing, retry, and failure policy at the call site; the Core boundary owns model resolution, timeout, cancellation, output bounds, usage collection, and stream disposal. Production product code does not call `LLM.stream()` outside the Agent worker runner, and sessionless callers no longer construct `AgentTurn` streams directly. The setup capability probe remains the narrow bootstrap exception because it runs before normal runtime orchestration is available.

Sessionless work is appropriate only when the result is derived data and a durable transcript would be noise. Work that users or parent agents must inspect, resume, cancel, audit, or receive as a task belongs in a session. New ordinary child work uses Cortex rather than manually composing `Session.create()` with `SessionInvoke`; specialized existing flows such as `look_at` and Chronicler are explicit exceptions, not the default delegation contract.

SmartAllow remains in the sessionless family and calls `AgentCall.text()` with conservative fall-through: any failure returns `undefined` so the normal permission prompt path proceeds. New text-only Sessionless inference uses `AgentCall.text()` rather than adding a domain-local lifecycle wrapper unless the caller needs specialized parsing or usage accounting.

## Prompt Assembly

Prompt assembly is ordered from stable to volatile to maximize provider cache reuse.

| Layer                       | Content                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent base                  | Agent prompt or provider fallback prompt, always first.                                             |
| Static project instructions | Discovered instruction files and explicit instruction additions.                                    |
| Permission context          | Effective control profile, sandbox/workspace boundaries, and execution guidance.                    |
| Cortex context              | Parent task and delegated execution context.                                                        |
| Workflow context            | Plan, Lattice, Light Loop, or BlueprintLoop execution/audit contract.                               |
| Recall                      | Loop-stable Library memory and experience context.                                                  |
| Environment                 | Scope, workspace, platform, date, session, endpoint, and worktree facts.                            |
| Diagnostics and reminders   | Git health, coauthor reminder, Agenda wake-ups, Cortex status, planning reminder, and elapsed time. |

Stable system content and a cache breakpoint remain early. Volatile advisory context is placed according to provider prompt-cache policy: either as later system content or as a final `<runtime-context>` user message. The policy uses the resolved runtime profile identity for named account connections, so an account retains its canonical provider's proven cache layout even when its connection ID and generic SDK transport do not identify that provider.

Some managed-inference providers reject requests that lack a per-conversation request header the AI SDK never sends. The per-request header gate (`ProviderSessionHeader`) covers this at the two live call surfaces — the `AgentTurn` `streamText` call and the setup live probe. It resolves the effective endpoint (model options beat provider options, and the catalog API URL is only the fallback, mirroring SDK construction) and adds `x-opencode-session` with the Synergy session id only when that resolved endpoint is the OpenCode Go endpoint or the provider id is `opencode-go`; probes without a session send a one-shot UUID. The endpoint is parsed and compared on host and path, so lookalike hosts never receive the id, and a user-pinned header of any casing replaces the generated value instead of duplicating it. Headers must stay per-call: language-model instances are cached, so headers baked into provider options would leak one conversation id across every session sharing the cached instance. When another provider adds a per-conversation header requirement, extend this gate instead of baking headers into provider options.

Plugins can transform the system prompt at budget and final phases. If a transform removes every system message, Synergy restores the pre-transform system prompt rather than sending an empty safety/instruction context.

## Library Recall

Top-level sessions build memory and experience context in parallel from the current task text.

- `always` memories are included without semantic matching.
- `contextual` memories are retrieved with category-aware thresholds and limits.
- `search_only` memories are available only through memory tools.
- experiences are retrieved within the current Scope.
- child sessions receive lightweight always-only memory context.

Recall has a bounded timeout and a loop-level cache. The context remains available across steps and compaction boundaries. The root message records which memory or experience context was injected so the durable task can be inspected later.

## Tool Resolution and Execution

Tool definitions are filtered for agent visibility and current workflow before prompt budgeting. Immediately before execution, `ToolResolver` resolves availability and crosses the execution boundary described in [Execution boundaries](execution-boundaries.md).

`SessionProcessor` owns streamed tool state:

- tool input can move through generating, pending, and running states;
- streamed raw argument deltas are transport/progress data used for incremental bounds and diagnostics, while the AI SDK `tool-call.input` is the canonical input for final bounds, persistence, loop guards, permission evaluation, and execution;
- each provider call ID owns one runtime execution promise, so replayed AI SDK callbacks reuse the original result or error instead of repeating tool side effects;
- each execution has a settlement slot keyed by provider call ID;
- completed output, attachments, metadata, timing, and errors are persisted on the original tool part;
- settlement is terminal for that provider call ID, so late or replayed stream events cannot allocate a second tool part;
- more than one tool execution can settle without losing original message-part order;
- unresolved tools are completed with explicit abort or settlement errors;
- repeated identical calls can trigger loop protection or permission review.

Model tool-call repair is narrow: known tool names can be case-folded, and syntactically truncated JSON can be repaired only when native parsing fails and the resolved tool exists. Semantic schema errors and hallucinated tools are not rewritten into plausible calls.

## Loop Jobs and Guards

`LoopJob` is the pre/post step extension point. Jobs can be blocking or non-blocking and can react to registered signals.

Current loop-level behavior includes:

- compaction processing
- asynchronous old-tool-output pruning
- title, body, and turn diff summary generation
- Library experience chronicling
- repeated successful tool-call warnings
- repeated same-class tool-error stopping
- tool-category failure analysis and escalation

A blocking job can return `continue` to restart the loop after changing history or `stop` to finish without another model call. Non-blocking jobs capture detached payloads and cannot hold the critical execution path. By default every captured payload runs independently; a job opts into latest-pending coalescing only by defining a stable `key()`. Each background execution receives an abort signal and a finite timeout, so consumers must propagate cancellation through history reads, model calls, child-session work, and other long-running operations.

### Turn diff settlement

The `summarize` post-step job computes file diffs and derives title/body for each completed turn without joining the blocking loop path:

1. The job writes `diffState: { status: "pending", deadlineAt }` immediately so the frontend sees the pending state.
2. It computes diffs from the complete root turn's snapshot range (`step-start` → latest `step-finish` across its assistant revisions).
3. On success, it writes `{ diffs, diffState: { status: "ready" } }` atomically. A diff failure writes `{ diffState: { status: "error", code } }`; a per-run timeout applies `error/timeout` only while that turn is still `pending`, preserving a diff that already reached `ready` while later enrichment or session aggregation was running.
4. Title generation may proceed after either outcome. Body generation runs only after a successful non-empty diff settlement, and the applicable LLM calls run in parallel.

Concurrent summarizations for the same session use a FIFO queue keyed by terminal assistant revision, allowing later continuations of one root turn while coalescing duplicate triggers. Cancellation propagates through snapshot and LLM work, and a worker settles before the queue advances so late writes cannot overwrite a newer revision. A stale persisted `pending` state is projected to `error/timeout` at the backend read boundary. The frontend renders that server-owned state without comparing `deadlineAt` to its local clock. Each run owns a `diffCache` so its session-level and turn-level computations can share an identical in-flight snapshot range. See [Sessions and Messages — Turn Diffs](session-and-messages.md#turn-diffs) for the schema and contract.

The post-job captures only session, root-message, and terminal-revision identifiers, then independently reloads the compaction-aware model working set without retaining or populating the loop-scoped message cache. Once `SessionSummary` accepts a run, later queued revisions retain only their bounded root-turn snapshot rather than another full working set; session aggregation extends the discardable persisted summary cursor, while direct callers without a snapshot use the same detached working-set read. If an existing session aggregation has no cursor, bounded direct callers may read authoritative durable history once to initialize it.

## Prompt Budget

`PromptBudgeter` measures the complete request:

- stable and late system context
- projected history
- tool names, descriptions, schemas, and protocol overhead
- bounded estimates for historical image/file parts

The budget derives from the model's declared limits. For a context `C`, an effective requested output `O` bounded by the model's configured output and the global output maximum, and no explicit separate input limit, Synergy reserves the requested output plus a safety margin only when that reservation leaves a positive input envelope:

- `margin = min(32000, max(2048, ceil(C * 0.05)))`
- `inputEnvelope = C - O - margin` when the configured output is smaller than `C` and the result is positive

Models with an explicit input limit (for example 400k context / 272k input / 128k output) keep the input-based envelope instead. Fully shared windows and near-window output declarations that cannot leave positive input after the margin use the model's usable input rather than deriving a zero or negative compaction threshold. The soft compaction threshold is `floor(inputEnvelope * overflowThreshold)`, defaulting to 85% and configurable through `compaction.overflowThreshold` (see [Configuration](../reference/configuration-layout.md#compaction)).

Before each provider call, the per-request maximum output is clamped to the configured output and to the context remaining after the measured input and margin, so a long prompt cannot push the request past the window. An explicit per-request output limit remains effective when context metadata is unavailable. If no response space remains, automatic compaction runs first when enabled; Synergy permits one hard-overflow recovery attempt for the root before the next provider turn, then records a local actionable error instead of repeatedly compacting or sending a guaranteed-to-fail provider request.

After the first provider call, Synergy calibrates estimates using provider-reported input and output tokens plus the smaller newly accumulated delta. This avoids repeatedly estimating the entire prompt with a tokenizer that may not match the provider.

## Context Usage Snapshots

Before streaming a normal assistant step, `MessageV2.projectModelMessages()` derives history provenance in the same pass that emits provider messages, after effective-history filtering and workflow wrapping. After `PromptBudgeter.buildPlan()` applies the budget-phase provider and plugin transforms, `SessionInvoke` remaps those category hints over the plan's final messages, discarding removed content and classifying transformed or inserted content from its final provider role. It then adds only tool definitions that survive final availability resolution.

`AgentTurn` starts the provider turn first, then submits the final system, late-system, and remapped category contributions to the Control Plane-owned Context Usage estimator. Context Usage provenance and drafts never cross the Agent worker protocol. The estimator uses a separate worker thread, admits at most two concurrent jobs, times each job out after one second, and never queues overflow. Its request uses at most 64 representative strata and 2,048 sampled characters per category, with at most 256 sampled characters from one stratum; each sample is scaled over the source characters represented by its stratum so unsampled contributions remain part of the category estimate. Worker capacity, startup, execution, validation, or timeout failure resolves to no draft and cannot delay or fail the provider turn.

When the provider reports input usage for the completed step, `SessionProcessor` records the exact total and finishes the assistant without waiting for estimation. A successful draft is reconciled and persisted through a later ordinary message update that atomically merges only `contextUsage`; an absent or failed draft leaves `contextUsage` unset. `totalInput` is the provider-exact input total used by the latest call; category totals remain bounded UTF-8 estimates. If estimates exceed the exact total, category attribution is scaled down with largest-remainder rounding. Otherwise the unassigned difference is recorded as overhead. The snapshot also records provider/model identity, context and usable-input limits when known, estimator kind and sampling metadata, reconciliation mode and factor, and capture time.

Historical assistant messages that predate `contextUsage` remain valid. Their token totals are still available through the existing `tokens` field, but they do not receive a backfilled category breakdown. Existing version-1 snapshots with `estimator.kind = "model-tokenizer"` remain readable; new snapshots use `bounded-utf8`. The feature adds only an optional assistant-message field and uses existing message update events; it does not require a route, event, config, storage migration, or historical backfill.

## Compaction

Compaction establishes a new model-context boundary while preserving durable history.

### Triggering

Compaction can be requested explicitly or injected automatically when:

- prompt measurement crosses the configured soft budget;
- prompt measurement leaves no space for a model response; or
- the provider returns a recognized context-length error.

The request is a `compaction` part attached to root `R`. Pending requests are counted against completed compaction summaries for that same root, so a long task can compact more than once without endlessly reprocessing one request. A measured hard overflow receives at most one automatic compaction attempt for that root before the next provider turn; if the compacted prompt still leaves no response space, the loop terminates locally with the actionable context-budget error.

### Summary generation

The compaction job:

1. resolves the dedicated `compaction` agent and its available model, falling back to the root model;
2. projects the current effective history with no tools;
3. trims oldest summary input so the history, compaction prompt, a bounded summary output, and tokenizer margin fit the compaction model's context window, advancing the cut past any tool results whose assistant tool calls were omitted; the summarization call requests at most 32,000 output tokens (the model's configured output when smaller), and that output budget plus the margin is what the history trim reserves;
4. persists a hidden compaction attempt with `includeInContext = false` and `metadata.compactionAttempt.state = "running"` so streamed output remains auditable without affecting later prompts;
5. asks only for a structured continuation summary;
6. records provider or processor failures as terminal `failed` attempts with a sanitized serialized error, `visible = true`, and `includeInContext = false`; provider response headers and bodies are not retained on this visible audit record, while empty output becomes `empty` and stays hidden outside model context;
7. after a non-empty summary is complete, writes a `compaction_recovery` part and commits the assistant with attempt state `committed`, `summary = true`, `visible = true`, `includeInContext = true`, `parentID = R.id`, and `rootID = R.id`;
8. publishes `session.compacted` only after that commit.

The `summary` flag is the context-boundary commit marker, not an in-progress placeholder. The attempt state is the presentation lifecycle: `running` survives the processor's terminal checkpoint until the compaction owner resolves it to `committed`, `failed`, or `empty`. Failed attempts are visible terminal audit records but remain excluded from model context; empty attempts stay hidden. Neither failed nor empty attempts fulfill the request or establish a filtering or pruning boundary.

The compaction agent cannot use tools or continue the user's task. Its built-in permission layer denies every tool subject to normal configuration precedence, while the invocation independently passes an empty tool set so no configured permission can equip the compaction model with tools. Its prompt requires observed facts, completed work, current state, next steps, constraints, and relevant files without inventing progress.

The compaction call may reuse root `R` as its ephemeral user envelope for task identity, but it clears `R.variant` before preparing the dedicated compaction model. The persisted root remains unchanged, while the compaction model uses its own normal provider options without validating or applying a variant owned by a different model execution.

If the summarization call itself exceeds context, Synergy writes a deterministic mechanical fallback and commits it through the same boundary. Other compaction-model failures remain explicit failures.

### Anchor and continuation

The active task anchor is resolved directly from root `R`: user-authored text first, then the root summary title. There is no backward heuristic scan or carried anchor metadata.

Automatic compaction writes a hidden non-root system continuation belonging to `R`, includes the anchor, and returns `continue`. The continuation also carries a deterministic recovery hint: use the summary as the primary handoff, avoid repeating completed work, and only when exact earlier message context is missing, expand the deferred Session tools if needed and use `session_read` around the compaction summary message. The next iteration rereads filtered history and resumes the same task.

### Filtering and pruning

Later model projection keeps the boundary root, completed summaries for that root, and messages after the latest summary. Earlier completed summaries remain available for audit but are marked out of context. The underlying pre-compaction messages remain in durable storage and can still be inspected through raw/full history paths.

Model working-set loading applies rollback before boundary selection and restores legacy stable-ID chronology from message creation time. It scans all small message-info records but loads parts only for the selected working set. The active loop caches that projected set and maintains it incrementally; it never retains the full pre-compaction transcript.

Separately, asynchronous pruning clears large outputs from older completed tool parts when all of these conditions hold:

- the output lies before the two most recent protected turns;
- it is not after an existing summary boundary;
- it is not already compacted;
- it is not from a protected tool such as `skill`;
- accumulated protected and prunable token thresholds are exceeded.

Pruning is configurable and records a compaction timestamp on the tool state. Pruning uses an independent compaction-aware working-set read so it cannot retain or populate the active loop's cache. Its `Session.updatePart()` writes still maintain the loop-scoped cache incrementally when that cache exists.

## Streaming and Persistence

Text, reasoning, and tool parts are persisted throughout the step. Streaming text/reasoning writes are coalesced at a short write-behind interval; terminal and discrete updates flush immediately. Before a turn finalizes, pending writes are flushed so a missing terminal callback cannot silently lose accumulated text.

Inside an Agent worker, the `LLM.stream()` consumer takes one owned full stream through the shared `LLM` ownership helper. The helper immediately cancels the residual branch retained by the AI SDK's internal stream tee and settles that cancellation after the consumed branch finishes. Normal turn completion also removes the session-abort listener and closes the per-turn combined signal; settled streams cannot remain anchored until the whole session exits.

Tool definitions cross the Agent worker boundary as plain JSON Schema data. AI SDK runtime wrappers, including symbol-keyed validator metadata, remain Control Plane-owned and are not included in worker turn snapshots.

The external `AgentTurn` boundary transfers immutable turn snapshots through a versioned, schema-validated protocol. Before transfer, the Control Plane runs prompt and parameter plugin hooks, resolves the built-in provider profile, strips executable provider options, freezes provider request timeouts into the worker plan, and retains optional Context Usage provenance locally. Requests are capped at 64 MiB and paged through acknowledged 1 MiB chunks rather than one unbounded IPC object. Worker event frames are Synergy-owned projections rather than raw AI SDK stream objects: lifecycle events retain only fields consumed by the Control Plane, so provider request bodies, response diagnostics, warnings, Context Usage provenance, and Context Usage drafts do not cross the process boundary. Frames are capped at 2 MiB, text/reasoning deltas coalesce up to 16 ms or 32 KiB, and adjacent tool-input deltas coalesce by call ID up to 32 KiB while preserving cross-call event order. Each emitted frame remains the only buffered frame until the Control Plane consumer acknowledges it.

The executable entrypoint is a thin bootstrap with no static application dependencies. It selects the main CLI/server, Agent runner, Policy runner, or Plugin runner through one mutually exclusive dynamic import. The Agent runner then has its own enforced static runtime boundary: its value-import graph may include only worker-safe, side-effect-free schemas and helpers (`provider/models-schemas.ts`), the LLM loop, serializable schemas, provider reconstruction, and lazily loaded selected-provider SDK. It must not include `provider/models.ts` (runtime/cache/macro dependent), `provider/models-macro.ts` (compile-time external network I/O), Browser, Tool, Plugin, Plugin Runtime, or `packages/browser` implementations. ModelsDev runtime, catalog, and macro remain Control Plane / host-only; no compile-time or module-load external network or other unbounded I/O may execute before the worker `ready`/heartbeat. When this import boundary changes, update and run `test/session/agent-worker-runtime-boundary.test.ts`.

The pool is elastic. `agentWorkers` is its parallelism ceiling; demand starts workers up to that ceiling instead of preallocating the full pool. `agentWorkerMinIdle` optionally maintains a warm reserve, and workers above the reserve retire after `agentWorkerIdleTimeoutMs`. Raising the ceiling admits queued demand without eagerly filling unused capacity. Lowering it releases excess idle workers immediately and marks excess active workers to retire only after their current turns reach the worker-release boundary. Queue count and aggregate bytes are bounded independently. Cancellation, heartbeat timeout, startup circuit breaking, crash containment, soft RSS/heap recycling, hard RSS/heap containment, turn-count recycling, and parent-death cleanup affect only the owned turn.

Agent worker provider-model caches include a one-way credential fingerprint, so installing a new per-turn provider plan cannot reuse a model instance created with an older key. A worker that exits before the `ready` handshake is treated as a startup failure. Replacement attempts use exponential backoff starting at 250 ms and capped at 256 seconds, the largest exponential step below five minutes, but the recovery budget is a fixed five-minute wall-clock window anchored at the first failure. Each delay is truncated to the time remaining, an independent deadline timer opens the circuit even while a retry is pending, and a successful `ready` handshake resets both the failure count and the window. The startup-failure counter is shared across Agent workers, so concurrent failures advance the exponential sequence but never extend the first-failure deadline. The Policy worker pool intentionally shares only the backoff calculation: it keeps its shorter 250 ms to 4 second schedule and opens after the sixth failed startup so classification remains within its 10-second readiness bound and preserves fail-closed enforcement behavior.

A provider terminal result does not make a worker assignable. The runner first reports `complete` or `error`, then releases the provider stream and per-turn references, reports before-dispose and after-dispose memory, performs the platform release collection, and finally sends `released` with the settled memory snapshot. Only `released` clears pool ownership and permits another turn. Linux uses the process-wide coalesced collection coordinator for one full release collection; other platforms report release memory without forcing a full collection. The pool records RSS, heap used/total, external, and array-buffer memory at ready, heartbeat, before-dispose, after-dispose, and released phases. RSS and heap each have a soft recycle watermark and a hard containment watermark fixed at twice soft. An active worker that crosses soft receives a full collection request, but its active-turn sample does not force retirement. The `released` sample after per-turn references are dropped decides whether soft pressure persists: a worker still between soft and hard recycles, while a recovered worker remains reusable. Hard RSS can terminate immediately as last-resort containment, while hard heap terminates only on a full-collection sample. Linux can also recycle an idle worker when its released RSS or external memory grows beyond the minimum warm baseline, and maximum turns remains an independent limit.

Normal session turns also carry one bounded memory-attribution handle from history projection through stream disposal. It records estimated history bytes before and after projection, the prepared request and tool-schema bytes, streamed output and raw tool-input characters, active turn and stream counts, and process-memory deltas relative to turn start. Memory checkpoints run before and after projection, after stream startup, periodically while a stream remains active, at bounded tool-input intervals, and after stream disposal. Checkpoints publish sizes and deltas only; prompt text, tool input, and response content never enter observability.

Memory checkpoints share one process-wide collection coordinator. Concurrent turns coalesce behind one in-flight request, all pressure levels observe the same minimum interval, and routine collection is asynchronous so critical pressure cannot make each active turn trigger another synchronous full GC on the server event loop.

After a normally settled model turn, the loop clears large prompt, tool, projection, and provenance containers in place before dropping its local references. The Agent worker releases its provider stream before the Control Plane authorizes or dispatches proposed tools, so permission waits, tool execution, questions, and child sessions never retain an Agent slot. A timed-out processor may still be consuming its input, so that abandoned path drops loop references without mutating the shared containers.

Provider SSE input passes through a 16 MiB per-event **SSE event parser bound** before it enters the AI SDK parser. The bound terminates an event whose encoded bytes exceed that threshold, preventing unbounded parser state for one unterminated event; it is not a limit on the total response, transport chunk size, or process memory. Provider body wrappers read only on downstream demand and release their owned reader after normal completion, upstream failure, timeout, or downstream cancellation. Streamed tool-call input is bounded independently at 1 MiB for both incremental deltas and final-only provider calls, and an oversized call is rejected before tool execution with terminal tool and assistant errors.

Persisted file diffs retain at most 8,000 characters of preview per file and at most 1 MiB of UTF-8 preview bytes across one diff array. Once the aggregate budget is exhausted, later entries keep file, additions, deletions, binary, and byte-size metadata, omit `preview`, and set `truncated = true`. New snapshots, imports, canonical reads, and the session migration apply the same bound.

Client wire transport can replace full accumulated streaming parts with incremental delta frames and periodic full checkpoints. That optimization does not change the in-process message or event model; see [Frontend data sync](frontend-data-sync.md).

## Completion, Abort, and Errors

When the inner loop reaches a terminal assistant:

- post-step jobs run;
- the next queued task may start in the outer loop;
- when no runnable work remains, `pendingReply` is cleared;
- completion notification state is updated;
- waiters receive the selected terminal assistant.

Provider, auth, output-length, timeout, abort, and unknown failures are persisted on the assistant message with terminal timing and canonical `finish: "error"`. A terminal assistant error is then propagated to callers such as Cortex so a failed task cannot be reported as completed.

Startup reconciliation, Abort, and the pre-wake guard share one root-anchored, idempotent terminal repair. It canonicalizes a failed assistant that has an error or completion time but lacks a terminal finish without replacing its structured error, terminalizes a genuinely incomplete assistant with an aborted error, or creates one terminal aborted assistant when the latest reply-required root has none. Repair clears stale `pendingReply` and never invokes the model or tools.

Abort never publishes lifecycle idle by itself. The owner remains in `stopping` until its loop exits and releases the lease, after terminal persistence and waiter settlement. A repeated abort reports that stopping is already in progress, while the client may project immediate local stopping feedback during the request. Abort carries explicit `recoverQueuedTasks` intent, recorded on the loop owner when the first abort wins: only the user-facing abort entries (the abort route and the `session_control` abort action) set it, and release then schedules the pending-work drive so task-mode inbox items queued during the run are recovered by the release-driven arbitration instead of stranding until the next user message. Internal cancellations — Boss task cancel, Lattice run cancel/pause, Cortex timeouts — abort before removing their own inbox items, so they leave the intent unset and release never races that cleanup. Ordinary loop failures keep the suppressed no-hammering release behavior.

## Invariants

- One lease owns one session at a time across starting, running, and stopping phases.
- Every assistant step remains attached to the current root `R`.
- Steer is drained before the call predicate; context only piggybacks on an already-required call.
- Stored user text is not rewritten to apply workflow instructions.
- Prompt assembly keeps stable content before volatile advisory context.
- Tool visibility and tool execution permission remain separate stages.
- Model-facing tools are serializable schemas without `execute()` callbacks.
- Agent workers never write canonical session state or wait for permission/tools after their provider turn ends.
- ToolTask identity includes session generation, message, call, executor, and attempt; dispatch never automatically replays a possibly side-effecting running call.
- Sessionless internal inference never implies durable task history or Cortex lifecycle.
- New inspectable delegated or reviewed work enters the session model through Cortex.
- Automatic compaction is a resumable context boundary, not history deletion.
- Compaction can repeat for a long root task and always resolves its anchor from that root.
- Terminal failures are persisted and propagated; they are never silently converted into successful task completion.
