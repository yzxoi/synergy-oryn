# Workspace and File Operations

Synergy keeps project ownership (`Scope`) separate from the directory in which a session executes (`workspace`). The normal workspace is the selected project directory; a session can instead bind to a Synergy-managed worktree without changing its owning Scope, config, Notes, or session index.

## Scope Runtime Services

A project `ScopeRuntime` starts project-sensitive services lazily and disposes them as a unit:

- file watching and ignore rules
- formatter discovery and format-on-write events
- LSP clients, diagnostics, hover, symbols, and code actions
- VCS state and Git operations
- configured commands and project instructions
- plugin/MCP state that resolves in project context

These services use the session's active directory while events remain routed to the owning Scope. A worktree is therefore another execution directory for the same project context, not a second project.

## Worktree Ownership

Worktrees have explicit owners such as a session, Cortex task, Blueprint workflow, or internal orchestration record. Creating or entering a worktree updates session workspace binding; leaving returns to the project checkout according to the worktree lifecycle.

The active worktree is the default write and execution boundary. Ordinary files in the original checkout can be read when they are not sensitive, but autonomous work cannot modify or execute from the original checkout. Cleanup removes resources only when their recorded owner permits it; a worktree is not inferred to be disposable merely because one session stopped using it.

Worktree use and removal share one in-process lifecycle gate. Session execution reserves the worktree before project services start, while create, enter, and leave reserve it around binding changes. Removal first excludes new users, refreshes the binding registry, and refuses any active session use; only then can it migrate idle bound sessions back to the main checkout and remove the directory. Binding registry updates are serialized per worktree so concurrent enters and leaves cannot overwrite one another. A stale managed record whose Git worktree and directory are already gone is cleaned from the registry after its idle bindings are migrated, without attempting filesystem status or deletion.

The Settings worktree browser queries only Git project Scopes and keeps successful project results when another repository is unavailable. List enrichment is concurrency-bounded. Dirty state is reported for live Git worktrees; managed worktrees also report checkout file bytes, excluding shared Git metadata. Main and external worktrees remain visible but read-only in this surface.

## Web Workspace File Service

The Web file workspace exposes scoped routes for directory children, file metadata, text/image preview, PDF byte streaming, file/content/symbol search, VCS status, and user-direct file writes. Every path is resolved inside `ScopeContext.current.directory`. Lexical escapes, control characters, and symlinks whose real path escapes the workspace are denied.

Directory results can hide ignored and dot-prefixed entries, are sorted with directories first, and use bounded cursor pages. Reads distinguish:

- UTF-8 text with line range, byte size, truncation, and next range
- bounded inline images encoded for preview
- unsupported binary or oversized content with a reason

PDF preview is a separate bounded byte stream: `GET /workspace/files/content` (operationId `workspace.files.content`) serves the raw bytes of a workspace PDF with `Content-Type: application/pdf` and `Cache-Control: no-store`. It accepts `.pdf` by extension or `application/pdf` MIME, rejects non-PDF files with `WorkspaceFileUnsupportedPreviewError` (400) and files over 50 MiB with `WorkspaceFileTooLargeError` (400), and reuses the same 403/404 error shapes as the other routes. PDF bytes never enter the JSON `read` union, so a PDF still reads back as `kind: "binary"` metadata.

Search has three independent modes:

- files — a cached workspace index plus fuzzy path matching
- content — bounded fixed-string ripgrep results
- symbol — active LSP workspace-symbol results, with an explicit unavailable capability when no LSP client is active

File-index scans consume and retain at most 50,000 complete paths, deduplicate retained paths, preserve results collected before a subprocess output limit or scan timeout, and mark the search response as truncated whenever a bound is reached. A workspace that is too large for one bounded index scan therefore returns partial file matches instead of failing the route with a 500 response or retaining an output-sized object graph indefinitely.

File-result path enrichment has its own finite timeout and fails open to the complete basic path results when optional metadata is unavailable. Caller cancellation still propagates, while `truncated` remains reserved for an incomplete index or result page.

The classic debug file search is lazy and reuses this same bounded project index. Starting a project Scope does not launch a second fire-and-forget repository scan.

The current public workspace-file routes are read/browse/search/status contracts plus `POST /workspace/files/write` (operationId `workspace.files.write`), a user-direct edit channel. Writes are bounded by the same path rules as reads — lexical escapes, control characters, and symlinks whose real path escapes the workspace are denied — and additionally:

- sensitive paths are rejected via `SensitivePathPolicy` in write mode (Git metadata and secret/credential files such as `.git`, `.env`, and credential stores are not editable), and the check also runs against the resolved real path so a symlink whose target is a sensitive file cannot bypass it
- the target must be an existing regular file; directories and read-only filesystem targets are refused
- an optional `expectedMtime` optimistic lock rejects a concurrent on-disk change with 409 unless the caller opts into `conflictPolicy: "overwrite"`
- content is capped at 8 MiB and parent-directory creation is opt-in via `createParents`

Write failures use the same structured error shape as the rest of the API: `{ name, data: { message } }` with `WorkspaceFileAccessDeniedError` (403), `WorkspaceFileWriteConflictError` (409), `WorkspaceFileTooLargeError` (400), and `NotFoundError` (404).

A successful write invalidates the Git-status cache and the frontend refreshes through the filesystem watcher; no `file.edited` event is published. This route is the user editing their own workspace directly: it is profile-independent and bypasses the agent approval/sandbox pipeline, so path safety is enforced by the service itself rather than by execution policy. Agent write operations remain separate and use the governed tool pipeline (write/save_file tools with permission decisions, locking, events, formatting, and diagnostics), never this route.

## File Workbench Ownership and Bounds

`packages/app/src/context/file/index.tsx` is the single frontend data owner for the File workbench. File tabs live in the Side Workspace as resource tabs. The Context panel is a separate session-scoped Side Workspace singleton and does not own files. Web and Desktop use generated `workspace.files.*` SDK calls against the active Scope rather than renderer or Electron-main filesystem reads.

Each session persists its open files, active tab, source/preview mode, selection, scroll state, and Explorer layout. Scope-level directory state keeps the expanded tree and hidden/ignored preference warm across sessions in the same project.

The workbench keeps resource use bounded:

- server directory pages resolve nodes with concurrency 16
- frontend directory requests use concurrency 6 and document reads use concurrency 3
- document content keeps at most 24 entries or about 32 MiB
- PDF preview bytes live in a separate cache with a 50 MiB per-file cap and at most two decoded buffers, keeping open tabs protected
- Monaco keeps at most 12 models or about 24 MiB
- the Explorer keeps at most 25,000 loaded nodes and virtualizes visible rows

The project watcher is enabled by default. The workspace subscription excludes `.synergy` and other high-cost repository/build paths, while a separate `.synergy` subscription accepts only classified project runtime inputs such as config, agents, commands, skills, and custom tools. This keeps managed worktrees, caches, logs, and runtime state out of the workspace event path without making `.synergy` unavailable to explicit File workbench browsing. Folder ignores are plain top-level names (native top-level prefix paths: kernel exclusions on macOS, prefix pruning on Windows) **plus** recursive globs (`**/.synergy/**`, `**/node_modules/**`, …), so nested occurrences such as a generated worktree's `node_modules` are pruned at any depth of the Linux inotify tree walk and by every backend's event filter. User `watcher.ignore` extras are passed through verbatim and may be top-level folder names or absolute paths.

On Linux, an inotify capacity error (`ENOSPC`, "No space left on device") stops live watching instead of retrying: the kernel watch table cannot clear while the process runs, and each retried recursive scan repeats the native allocation that exhausted it. The first failure trips a process-wide breaker — the native backend and its watch budget are shared by every scope — so the failing scope's remaining subscriptions and other scopes' subscriptions skip native scans until `FileWatcher.reload()` resets the breaker or the process restarts; the error is logged with remediation guidance (raise `fs.inotify.max_user_watches` or open a smaller workspace, then reload watcher state or restart). `SYNERGY_DISABLE_FILEWATCHER=1` remains a full diagnostic escape hatch. Because Linux inotify scans cannot be cancelled, recovery never abandons an in-flight subscribe at the generic 10s timeout, and watcher state initialization never blocks on a native settle — the attempt runs in the background, settles before the next attempt starts, and cannot leak partial watches into the shared native backend.

A Linux scan that stalls rather than failing (typically a network-filesystem subtree such as NFS/autofs) is not cancelled: later Linux subscriptions queue behind it, one stall warning is logged after 60 seconds, and a settle notice follows when the scan ends. If the kernel watch budget was exhausted by sibling processes rather than this process — the budget is per-user — it can recover once they exit, but re-arming live watching still requires a watcher reload or restart.

Workspace events enter one per-Scope drain that deduplicates paths, processes one batch at a time, bounds pending paths, and updates the file index without resolving Git status. Git-status reads share one in-flight build and perform at most one follow-up build when invalidated during that work. VCS branch refreshes run only for the dedicated Git `HEAD` event, not for ordinary file changes. If the watcher queue overflows, the backend invalidates its caches and emits one `file.watcher.updated` event with `resync: true`; the File context refreshes the root, expanded directories, and active document. `SYNERGY_DISABLE_FILEWATCHER=1` remains a diagnostic escape hatch. Refocus, refresh, and directory expansion still validate state, so correctness does not depend on lossless per-file delivery.

## Classic and Anchored Coding Tools

Synergy supports ordinary file tools and an anchored coding harness. The anchored family uses:

- `view_file` for an exact file/range view
- `scan_files` for bounded text matches
- `parse_code` for AST-aware matches
- `revise_file` for surgical changes
- `resolve_conflicts` for atomic, tag-checked merge-conflict resolution
- `save_file` for new files or intentional full-file replacement

Anchored reads return a `[path#TAG]` representing a session-local snapshot of that file. Displayed lines are recorded separately. `revise_file` accepts only a real current tag and operations on lines that the agent actually saw; fabricated, stale, truncated, or unseen anchors are rejected. `resolve_conflicts` also requires the current tag and exactly one explicit resolution for every conflict block in the file.

Every successful edit mints a new tag and makes older tags stale. The patch language applies all ranges to the original snapshot, resolves block operations with syntax-aware parsing, rejects overlapping/duplicate file sections, detects no-op loops, and refuses surgical edits across unresolved merge-conflict markers. A conflicted file must be resolved atomically with `resolve_conflicts`, or intentionally replaced in full with `save_file`. This turns freshness and observed context into enforced preconditions rather than prompt-only advice.

`save_file` bypasses line-level anchoring because it owns the complete replacement. It still crosses normal permission, conflict, formatting, diagnostic, snapshot, and event boundaries.

## Write Pipeline

A governed file write can include:

1. path resolution and protected/external path classification
2. current-content and conflict checks
3. user/profile permission decision with file diff metadata
4. per-file locking and atomic write
5. file-edited event and format-on-write
6. reread of formatter output
7. LSP diagnostic delta
8. runtime reload evaluation for affected Synergy/config/plugin sources
9. durable tool result, patch metadata, and session snapshot update

The exact stages vary by tool, but no write path should create a second unclassified filesystem capability.

## Snapshots, Rollback, and Restore

File snapshots share one Git object store and reference namespace per Scope under Synergy data. Each session and workspace identity has an independent, rebuildable index. `SnapshotStore` is the sole resolver for registered legacy repositories and the shared store; snapshot readers validate session ownership before using a tree hash. The user's Git repository is not an object-store dependency.

Capture holds a shared Scope lease and an exclusive session index lock, writes objects, and retains `refs/synergy/snapshots/<session>/<tree>` before returning the tree hash. All historical roots remain retained. Fork and JSON import establish destination ownership before publishing copied messages; JSON import reports unavailable file objects as warnings. Archive, compaction of messages, and transcript rollback do not release roots.

Permanent deletion writes a durable deletion job and tombstones the owner before removing canonical session data. Both ordinary removal and recovery removal finish the same cleanup; startup resumes pending jobs. Physical collection occurs only through explicit offline maintenance, under an exclusive Scope lease. Full-home copies also hold a home-wide lease that excludes creation of new snapshot Scopes during the copy. A failed integrity check or unfinished maintenance job blocks collection. Process start identities use a consistent UTC encoding; lease age alone never displaces a live process.

The central `20260907-snapshot-shared-store` migration inventories owners without scanning objects. Explicit maintenance imports missing objects through a streaming SQLite inventory, preserves unknown objects, verifies roots, switches the owner, and then removes the legacy copy. Full-data archives materialize alternates and merge Git objects and references separately from JSON files. See [storage layout](../reference/storage-and-paths.md), [maintenance commands](../reference/cli-guide.md), and [the storage decision](../decisions/implemented/architecture/2026-09-07-shared-file-snapshot-storage.md).

Message rollback changes the effective transcript through history events. It does not modify project files. Restoring files is an explicit operation that checks the selected snapshot/patch records and reports per-file failures. Redo is constrained once newer history makes the rollback ambiguous.

## Invariants

- Scope owns project context; workspace owns the execution directory.
- Worktree removal excludes new execution and binding use before it validates and migrates current bindings.
- Web file routes never escape the active workspace, including through symlinks; user-direct writes additionally reject sensitive paths, read-only targets, and conflicting mtimes.
- File workbench state and caches have one frontend owner and explicit concurrency/size bounds.
- Tool reads and writes still cross execution-policy and sensitive-path checks.
- Anchored tags prove a file snapshot; seen-line tracking proves the agent observed an edit range.
- Formatting and diagnostics run after the persisted write and can change the final returned tag/diff.
- Transcript rollback and file restoration are separate explicit operations.
