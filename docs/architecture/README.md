# Synergy Architecture

These documents define the current implementation invariants of the Synergy runtime. They describe supported behavior directly; design exploration, issue history, and retired schemas belong in research or migration documents.

Code is authoritative. When code changes one of these contracts, update the owning document in the same change.

## System Shape

Synergy is a client-server system built around a persistent runtime:

1. The global runtime owns installation-wide services such as plugins, Channels, Holos, MCP, Agenda, recovery, and marketplace state.
2. A `Scope` selects home or project context for each request and session.
3. A lazily started project `ScopeRuntime` owns project-sensitive services such as file watching, LSP, formatting, VCS, and command state.
4. A durable session owns messages, inbox state, session-local workflow state, workspace binding, and at most one active LLM loop.
5. The LLM loop resolves agent, model, context, tools, execution policy, and persistence for one root task at a time.
6. The event system projects state changes to Web and Desktop clients, which reconcile them into scope-local stores.

Web, Desktop, CLI, Channels, Agenda, Cortex, and plugins all enter this same runtime model. They do not own parallel session or permission semantics.

## Cross-Cutting Invariants

- The server is independent of any single project directory, but its state is persistent.
- Every scoped operation runs inside `ScopeContext`; session execution also carries an explicit workspace.
- One session has at most one active LLM loop and one writer to its loop-scoped message cache.
- One root user message owns a task. Injected messages and assistant messages retain that root through `rootID`.
- Message scheduling, rendering, model inclusion, and provenance are orthogonal fields.
- All session delivery uses the persistent inbox and one `mode`: `task`, `steer`, or `context`.
- Tool discovery and tool execution are separate. Every executable tool call crosses the centralized enforcement and permission boundary.
- State events are sequenced per Scope runtime; streaming part deltas are deliberately unsequenced and converge through checkpoints.
- Frontend updates reconcile changed leaves instead of replacing whole store objects.
- Product extensions use the same session, event, permission, and workbench contracts as built-in features.
- Channel core owns Scope and Session integration; task-only providers report remote facts through `ChannelHost` and do not maintain parallel Project or Session models.
- Persisted schema upgrades run through domain migrations and the central migration runner.

## Ownership Map

### Harness-core layering

The runtime enforces a hard layer boundary with `dependency-cruiser` (`bun run deps:check`, snapshot `bun run deps:analyze` from the repository root):

| Layer           | Directories                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Product domains own their tools (`<domain>/tools/` + `<domain>/tools.ts`), migrations (`<domain>/migration.ts`), and startup contributions (`<domain>/startup.ts`), registered through the L4 manifest that every real entry point loads.
