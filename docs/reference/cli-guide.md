# CLI Reference

The installed `synergy` CLI manages the product runtime and submits work to it. Source development uses the separate root `bun dev` orchestrator described in [Development](development.md).

Run `synergy --help` or `synergy <command> --help` for the exact options supported by the installed version.

## Global Options

| Option                                 | Meaning                                            |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `-h`, `--help`                         | Show command help                                  |
| `-v`, `--version`                      | Show the installed version                         |
| `--print-logs`                         | Mirror runtime logs to stderr                      |
| `--log-level DEBUG\|INFO\|WARN\|ERROR` | Override the configured log level for this process |
| `completion`                           | Generate a shell completion script                 |

## Runtime Modes

| Command            | Ownership and lifetime                                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `synergy start`    | Install/start a managed background service through launchd, systemd user services, or Windows Task Scheduler      |
| `synergy server`   | Run the server in the current foreground terminal; bare `synergy` is an alias for this command                    |
| `synergy web`      | Open the Web UI served by an already running runtime                                                              |
| `synergy send ...` | Attach to a runtime when `--attach` is supplied; otherwise start a private ephemeral local server for the command |

These modes share data and configuration when they use the same `SYNERGY_HOME`, but only one persistent server process may own that home at a time. A private `send` server stops when its task reaches idle.

### Background service

```bash
synergy start
synergy status
synergy status --verbose
synergy logs --follow
synergy stop
```

`start` runs the first-time configuration wizard in an interactive terminal when no config exists. `--non-interactive` skips first-run and Holos prompts. Existing services report config drift; stop and start again to install changed network settings into the service definition.

The managed service defaults to `127.0.0.1:4096`. `--hostname`, `--port`, `--mdns`, and repeatable `--cors` override the corresponding `server` config for the installed service invocation. Each explicit `--cors` value authorizes both cross-origin HTTP requests and Browser viewer WebSocket handshakes from that exact HTTP(S) origin. Automatically detected LAN CORS origins and reverse-proxy forwarding headers do not authorize Browser viewer sockets, so pass the public Browser viewer Origin explicitly.

`status --verbose` adds runtime-lock, health, process, listening-port, trace, and local process-registry information. `stop` manages only the installed background service; do not use it as a generic process killer for an unrelated foreground server.

### Foreground server

```bash
synergy server
synergy server --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 4097
```

The foreground command defaults its CLI hostname to `0.0.0.0`. Port `0` asks the server to prefer 4096 and fall back to an available ephemeral port. Global `server` configuration applies unless a network option is explicit. Use an explicit loopback hostname when the runtime should not accept LAN connections.

The server lock reports the existing PID, mode, working directory, command, health, and listening ports when another server already owns the same Synergy home.

### Web

```bash
synergy web
synergy web --attach http://localhost:4097
```

`web` does not start a server. It verifies `/global/health`, verifies that the target serves the Web application, and opens the authenticated attach URL. The default target is `http://localhost:4096`.

## One-off Work with `send`

```bash
synergy send "Summarize this project"
synergy send --scope home "Summarize recent work"
synergy send --scope <scope-id> "Continue work in that project"
synergy send --attach http://localhost:4096 "Continue the work"
synergy send --agent synergy-max --model provider/model "Fix the failing test"
synergy send --file report.pdf --file src "Review these inputs"
printf 'extra context' | synergy send "Use stdin too"
```

Important options:

| Option                           | Meaning                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--attach <url>`                 | Use a running server instead of a private ephemeral server                                                                                                      |
| `--scope <id>`                   | Use the registered home or project Scope ID; unknown or archived IDs fail without creation                                                                      |
| `-c`, `--continue`               | Continue the latest top-level session in the selected Scope                                                                                                     |
| `-s`, `--session <id>`           | Continue a specific session                                                                                                                                     |
| `--agent <name>`                 | Select a primary agent; subagent names are rejected as primary choices                                                                                          |
| `-m`, `--model <provider/model>` | Override the model                                                                                                                                              |
| `--variant <name>`               | Select provider-specific reasoning/model variant                                                                                                                |
| `-f`, `--file <path>`            | Attach a file or directory; repeatable                                                                                                                          |
| `--command <name>`               | Run a configured Synergy command, using the message as arguments                                                                                                |
| `--title [text]`                 | Set the new-session title; an empty value derives it from the prompt                                                                                            |
| `--workflow lightloop`           | Run the message as a Light Loop workflow task: the session enables `loop_stop` and a reviewer loop, and `send` exits when the workflow reaches a terminal state |
| `--format default\|json`         | Render progress for humans or emit newline-delimited event JSON                                                                                                 |
| `--port <number>`                | Port for the private local server; omitted means an available port                                                                                              |

When `--scope` is omitted, `send` uses the launch directory (or `SYNERGY_CWD`). An existing directory is resolved and registered as a project Scope when needed, even if Synergy has not opened it before; a missing directory resolves to the home Scope. Pass `--scope` to select an already registered Scope without registering the launch directory. With `--attach`, the target runtime owns and validates the Scope ID.

Piped stdin is appended to the prompt. The command subscribes to session events before prompting, renders completed tools and terminal text, and handles interactive `guarded` permission requests with allow-once or reject choices.

| `synergy config rerank`                      | Configure a rerank provider                                     |

| `synergy agent create\|list`                 | Create or inspect agent definitions                             |
| `synergy mcp add\|list\|auth\|logout\|debug` | Configure, authenticate, and inspect MCP servers                |

### config import

`synergy config import <source>` imports JSON or JSONC configuration from a local file path or an HTTP(S) URL. Sources are limited to 1 MiB; URL fetches time out after 15 seconds and reject redirects. The command produces a domain-aware plan, shows value-level changes, and asks for confirmation before applying.

```bash
synergy config import ./settings.jsonc
synergy config import https://example.com/config.json --dry-run
synergy config import ./config.jsonc --scope project --only models --only providers
synergy config import ./config.jsonc --mode replace-domain --yes
```

| Option                                 | Meaning                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--scope global\|project`              | Target scope; defaults to `global`; project scope requires an active project |
| `--only <domain>`                      | Import only the named domain; repeatable for multiple domains                |
| `--mode merge\|replace-domain\|append` | Override the per-domain default merge policy                                 |
| `--dry-run`                            | Show the plan without writing files                                          |
| `--force`                              | Apply even when config changed after planning (stale revision)               |
| `--yes`, `-y`                          | Skip the confirmation prompt                                                 |

All domains are importable and default to `merge` mode. `append` recursively merges objects and appends arrays in source order; imported scalar values override existing values. Conflicts and hardcoded secrets are flagged as warnings without blocking. A stale plan (config changed between plan and apply) is rejected unless `--force` is supplied.

JSONC comments in existing domain files are preserved. Committed files trigger a runtime config reload; reload failure does not roll back the committed changes.

### config export

`synergy config export` writes the merged config at the target scope as JSONC to stdout or a file. Secrets are replaced with the `__REDACTED__` sentinel by default; pass `--include-secrets` to keep plaintext values — a warning is printed to stderr either way, and files written with `--output` are chmod'd `0600`. A redacted export can be re-imported later — the import merges the sentinel with the stored secret (see [Configuration Layout: Config Export](configuration-layout.md#config-export)).

```bash
synergy config export > backup.jsonc
synergy config export --scope project --only providers --only models
synergy config export --include-secrets -o full-backup.jsonc
```

| Option                    | Meaning                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--include-secrets`       | Keep plaintext secrets; files written with this flag get `0600` permissions  |
| `--only <domain>`         | Export only the named domain; repeatable for multiple domains                |
| `--scope global\|project` | Source scope; defaults to `global`; project scope requires an active project |
| `--output`, `-o`          | Write to this file instead of stdout                                         |

Export semantics worth knowing:

- Export is read-only. A domain file that fails to parse is skipped and reported as a warning on stderr (the API result carries the same `warnings`) — it is not quarantined or moved aside.
- `{env:VAR}` and `{file:path}` references are resolved when the file is read, so the export contains resolved values. Re-importing such an export writes those values back as plaintext; if you rely on env-indirection, re-add the `{env:}` references after importing (see [Configuration Layout: Config Export](configuration-layout.md#config-export)).
- Relative `plugin` specs are exported relative to the config directory, keeping the payload machine-independent. Plugin directories themselves often differ between machines, so re-check plugin paths after a cross-machine import.
- The HTTP API (`GET /config/export`) is always redacted: `includeSecrets=true` is rejected with 400. Plaintext export is CLI-only.

The `openai-codex` provider uses ChatGPT/Codex OAuth credentials and the Codex backend. The `openai` provider uses OpenAI Platform API-key credentials. The `grok` provider uses xAI subscription OAuth credentials (SuperGrok / X Premium+) against the OpenAI-compatible `https://api.x.ai/v1` API. Their login, storage, usage, and billing semantics are intentionally separate. The Grok model list is discovered live from the xAI `/v1/language-models` API with the stored subscription OAuth credential and refreshes automatically (≤1h TTL, or via `synergy models --refresh`); offline or failed discovery falls back to the bundled list.

See [Configuration](configuration.md) for files, precedence, domains, and instruction discovery.

### embed download

`synergy embed download` fetches the bundled local embedding model (`Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, ~80 MB) so that embedding calls start instantly. The command is for local mode; when a remote embedding API key is configured it exits immediately with "No download needed."

```bash
synergy embed download
```

The command displays:

- the model name, size, and purpose
- the configured download source (Hugging Face Hub, HF Mirror, or custom)
- live byte and percentage progress, updated roughly every 250 ms
- success confirmation with the final "ready" message

On failure, the command prints the error and suggests troubleshooting steps: check the network connection, verify the configured download source in `embedding.local.source`, or configure a remote embedding API with `synergy config embedding`.

The download source is set in `00-general.jsonc` under `embedding.local.source` (`"huggingface"`, `"hf-mirror"`, or `"custom"`). The `custom` source requires `embedding.local.remoteHost` to be a public HTTPS origin.

When `source` is `"huggingface"` (the default) and a download fails, Synergy automatically retries once from hf-mirror.com, then falls back to the on-disk cache. Explicit `"hf-mirror"` and `"custom"` sources skip the auto-fallback and go straight to the disk cache. Remote downloads abort with an error if no response bytes arrive within 30 seconds (time-to-first-byte), so an unreachable source fails with a clear message instead of hanging at 0%.

Model files are cached under `~/.synergy/data/embedding/models`; customize the location with `embedding.local.cacheDir`.

See [Knowledge: Embedding Model](../product/knowledge.md#embedding-model) for the embedding lifecycle and [Configuration: Embedding](configuration-layout.md#embedding) for the full config schema.

`synergy data snapshots inspect` reports logical bytes, filesystem allocation, and storage ownership. `check` validates objects and historical roots. `migrate` imports registered legacy repositories; `compact` packs shared objects while preserving unreachable contents. Both default to dry-run and require `--apply` to execute. Non-pruning compaction preserves interrupted import packs under explicit unknown-object refs before releasing their import protection. Only `compact --apply --prune` collects unreferenced objects, after integrity and recovery checks. All four accept `--scope <id>` and `--json`; JSON results contain `ok`, `results`, and an optional structured `error`. Failed checks or execution return a nonzero exit status. Busy maintenance leaves the running instance untouched.

Use the data commands for supported relocation and merge workflows. Copying individual JSON files while the server is running can violate indexes and atomic update assumptions.

`synergy stats --json` emits the complete snapshot; `--recompute` rebuilds its derived digests and buckets, while `--days`, `--tools`, and `--models` change the displayed view. The accepted `--project` option currently recomputes but does not filter the installation-wide result. See [Activity and Statistics](../product/activity-and-statistics.md).

## Browser Installation and Diagnostics

```bash
synergy browser doctor
synergy browser doctor --json
synergy browser install
synergy browser install --force --json
synergy browser install --no-deps
synergy browser install-deps
```

`browser doctor` checks Chromium discovery, executable version, and an actual headless launch using the same arguments as Browser tools. On Linux it also reports dynamic-loader diagnostics. The command exits with status 1 when Browser is not ready; `--json` emits the complete structured report.

`browser install` downloads Chromium into Synergy-managed data without replacing system browsers. It accepts only a release manifest signed by Synergy, verifies the target, archive size, and SHA-256 digest, and installs atomically. Repeated installs reuse the current managed version; `--force` reinstalls it.

On Linux, `browser install` also installs the distribution packages required by the release's pinned Playwright version. This system-package step can invoke `sudo` or `su`; run it from an account authorized to install packages. Use `--no-deps` when those packages are managed separately, or run `browser install-deps` to repair only the system dependencies. JSON install reports include `systemDependencies` with `installed`, `not-required`, or `skipped`.

Local source builds do not have signed release manifests; use an installed release or set `CHROMIUM_PATH`. Unsupported platforms can also install Chrome or Chromium separately and set `CHROMIUM_PATH`.

`synergy doctor` lists the current installation method, every detected installation channel (`npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `bun`, `desktop`, or `standalone`) with its version and, where available, its executable, plus the `synergy` candidates on PATH. It exits nonzero when no supported installation is detected, when multiple channels coexist, or when an installed version cannot be verified. A PATH-first mismatch (the first `synergy` on PATH is not the current CLI) is reported as a warning. Homebrew's `synergy` formula is unrelated to this project and is not detected or managed.

`synergy upgrade` preserves the detected installation channel. Supported package-manager installations use their owning manager, Desktop installations defer to the Desktop updater, and standalone CLI installations rerun the official installer pinned to the requested release's `vX.Y.Z` GitHub tag. Standalone upgrades therefore require a published GitHub release tag and do not use an npm-only dev or preview version's installer. Override detection with `--method <npm|yarn|pnpm|bun|desktop|standalone>`; if multiple channels coexist and no override is provided, upgrade exits nonzero instead of guessing. Installer and package-manager warning checks are advisory and fail open, so probe failures do not block installation.

`synergy uninstall` removes the selected installation channel and, by default, the shared data, cache, config, and state directories; the existing `--keep-data` and `--keep-config` options still preserve the corresponding directories. Pass `--installation-only` to remove only the selected channel while preserving shared data, cache, config, and state. Use `--method <npm|yarn|pnpm|bun|desktop|standalone>` to select the channel when multiple are installed. Package-manager channels are removed through their owning package manager. Desktop removal cleans only the CLI link or Windows PATH entry and prints platform-specific app removal guidance. Standalone removal deletes only installer-owned runtime paths, preserves shared sandbox helpers and user data, removes all exact PATH entries written by the installer, and defers deletion of a running Windows executable until the process exits.

`debug` and migration commands are maintainer-oriented. Prefer stable product commands and APIs for application integrations.

## Plugins

`synergy plugin` includes create, add, remove, retry-install, update, build, sign, pack, list, search, doctor, validate, dev, runtime, test, publish-market, entry, info, permissions, and approval commands. `synergy plugin approve <id>` fetches the server approval review for a configured plugin and submits the opaque `reviewToken` through `POST /api/plugins/approve`; it does not send manifest, capability, source, or path data. `list` and `info` show approval-disabled plugins with their canonical identity and `Needs approval` state. Installed plugins can also contribute their own top-level CLI commands. `synergy plugin retry-install <id>` re-queues a failed or pending `lifecycle.install`; the host delivers it at the next server start or plugin runtime reload. It errors instead when the plugin's lockfile generation no longer matches the installed generation — reinstall or update the plugin to retry in that case.

The canonical authoring and command reference is [Plugin documentation](../plugins/README.md).
