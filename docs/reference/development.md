# Development Reference

Source development is orchestrated from the repository root with `bun dev`. The installed/product `synergy` CLI is a different surface.

One-shot and persistent-server execution share the runtime lifecycle. [Rollout execution](rollout.md) documents task configuration, durable evidence, import/export and accounting boundaries.

## Requirements and Preparation

The root manifest pins Bun `1.3.14`. Install that version, then run:

```bash
bun dev prepare
```

Preparation installs dependencies, generates OpenAPI/SDK artifacts, builds the plugin SDK and Web app, and prepares the platform sandbox helper where supported. Linux and Windows helper compilation requires Rust; Linux sandboxing also uses Bubblewrap. `build-helper.ts --local` installs the local helper without editing tracked trust hashes. Stable builds compile each release helper first and embed its SHA-256 into the matching runtime binary.

## Development Modes

```bash
bun dev server
bun dev app --open
bun dev web
bun dev desktop
bun dev desktop --managed
bun dev send "your message"
bun dev build app
bun dev build desktop
```

| Mode                | Processes                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `server`            | source server on fixed development port 4096 by default                   |
| `app`               | Vite app against an existing server; default app port 3000                |
| `web`               | source server, Vite app, and remote Browser Host                          |
| `desktop`           | source server, Vite app, and Electron in external-server mode             |
| `desktop --managed` | build plugin/app, then Electron with production-style managed server mode |
| `send`              | one-off source CLI execution                                              |

Use `--port` for standalone `server` and `app` modes. Use `--server-port`, `--app-port`, `--hostname`, and `--attach` for combined Web or Desktop flows. `--hostname` binds both the source server and Vite app in Web and external Desktop modes. The orchestrator checks required ports and target health before starting dependent processes. Parallel and serial modes terminate complete descendant process trees, including nested package scripts that create another process group, so stopping the orchestrator does not leave servers or Electron hosts running.

Managed Desktop rebuilds the Web distribution before launch so packaged-server behavior is not tested against stale frontend assets. Its server also watches the Electron parent and shuts down if Electron is force-terminated without running normal quit handlers. Normal daily Desktop work should use external mode for Vite reload speed.

Managed Desktop shows data-update progress before the application opens. Each percentage applies to the current migration step or scan phase. Advancing migration work renews a five-minute inactivity deadline; after migrations complete, the server has 30 seconds to become healthy. The same waiting policy applies to source and packaged runtimes.

CLI startup displays pending migration steps, a progress bar, percentages and processed/total counts on stderr. This applies to foreground server startup, background-service setup and local `synergy send`, including JSON output mode. Redirected stderr uses plain append-only lines; terminals update the current line. Unknown totals show preparation status until counts are available. Percentages describe the current migration step or scan phase, and completion or failure restores terminal wrapping. `NO_COLOR` suppresses color, and `TERM=dumb` also suppresses cursor control. The managed server command selects Desktop’s structured progress stream. ACP startup keeps migrations silent, including when it inherits the Desktop progress environment flag, so stdout remains an ACP protocol stream.

Vite development and App builds launched through `bun dev` identify themselves as `local@<git-revision>` (with `+dirty` when applicable) on fatal and startup error pages and emit source maps for diagnostics. The semantic package version remains unchanged for update compatibility. Direct package and release builds keep the package version label and do not emit source maps by default.

Managed Desktop resolves the current user's login shell once during Desktop startup and imports only a normalized `PATH` into the managed server environment. Login-shell entries take precedence while inherited absolute entries remain as fallbacks; other profile variables and output are discarded. If the probe fails, Desktop keeps its inherited `PATH`. The Bash tool still executes commands with the ordinary non-login `shell -c` path and the existing sandbox environment allowlist. Developer-mode Settings → Observability shows the effective Desktop `PATH`, its source, and fixed command-resolution diagnostics.

Managed Desktop always starts its private Synergy server with `--hostname 127.0.0.1`. Plugins with approved `runtime.endpoint.read` access may read that credential-free loopback origin; the Host Service serves loopback and wildcard binds over loopback and fails closed only when the listener excludes loopback.

The development orchestrator tags each spawned command so shutdown can recover descendant process groups after an intermediate package wrapper exits. Managed servers arm cross-platform parent-process liveness monitoring before startup work can report healthy.

## Developing Synergy with Synergy

Do not restart or stop the Synergy instance carrying your current session. Run the source checkout against an isolated home and explicit alternate ports:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/synergy-dev/.synergy
cp -r ~/.synergy/config /tmp/synergy-dev/.synergy/config

SYNERGY_HOME=/tmp/synergy-dev \
  bun dev web --server-port 4097 --app-port 3001
```

The config copy preserves provider setup while `SYNERGY_HOME` isolates data, logs, daemon state, and locks. Never run `synergy stop` against the main instance as part of a source test.

## Tests

Core runtime tests run from `packages/synergy`:

```bash
cd packages/synergy
bun test
bun run test:ci
bun test test/tool/read.test.ts
bun run test:changed
bun run test:coverage
bun test --watch
```

`bun run test:ci` matches the CI core-suite boundary: sequential batches run in separate Bun processes (four hash-shards of the main batch plus one process per isolated suite), limiting process-global state and temporary fixture accumulation while avoiding concurrent port and environment collisions. Set `SYNERGY_TEST_JUNIT_DIR` to a package-relative directory when per-shard JUnit reports are needed.

`bun run test:coverage` runs through `script/coverage-run.ts`, which splits the main batch by stable file-name hash into sequential single-process shards (default 4, `SYNERGY_BATCH_SHARDS`) plus per-file batches for known shared-process-sensitive suites, and spawns every coverage batch with an injected isolated test home. `bun run test:ci` consumes the same batch plan (`script/test-ci.ts` imports the planner from `coverage-run.ts`), so the isolation list protects both the Test and Coverage jobs — Bun's native `--shard` cannot exclude files, which is why the orchestrators pass explicit file lists. Because shard assignment hashes the file path, editing the isolation list never reshuffles the remaining files' shard neighbors. Both orchestrators (`test-ci.ts`, `coverage-run.ts`) set `SYNERGY_TEST_HOME`/`SYNERGY_TEST_ROOT` in the child environment and delete `SYNERGY_HOME`, because Bun 1.3.x does not propagate `test/preload.ts` environment into `--parallel` worker processes — a raw `bun test --coverage --parallel` run would fall through to the real user home and write fixtures into `~/.synergy/data`…

For the full isolation procedure, the guard predicate, and the escape hatch, see the `testing-guide` Skill (`.synergy/skill/testing-guide/SKILL.md`). Run core suites through the package scripts; the only escape hatch for a deliberate real-home test run is `SYNERGY_ALLOW_REAL_HOME=1` (see [Configuration layout](configuration-layout.md)).

The same pinned catalog is the default input for core binary builds. `packages/synergy/script/models-catalog.ts` validates it and requires non-empty OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google entries before compilation; `MODELS_DEV_API_JSON` can override the input for an ordinary local build, while release builds always force the repository-pinned snapshot.

Other package tests can run through Turbo or their package scripts:

```bash
bun turbo test
bun run desktop:test
bun run --cwd packages/app test
bun run --cwd packages/ui test
```

Every test file lives under the owning package's `test/` directory; repository script and policy tests live under the root `test/` directory. Mirror source-domain subdirectories where useful, but never colocate `*.test.*` or `*.spec.*` beside implementation files. Run `bun run test-layout:check` to validate the repository boundary.

The App and shared UI package scripts are part of the Turbo test graph. The App runner isolates its production CSS build contract from ordinary unit tests. The UI runner executes ordinary suites together and isolates the session-turn timeline suite so its global module mocks cannot contaminate neighboring tests.

Theme source changes also regenerate the static boot fallback, Tailwind color mappings, and JSON schema from the canonical token catalog:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/ui generate:theme
```

Frontend product colors must use the canonical semantic theme contract. Do not add Tailwind palette colors, arbitrary literal color utilities, or component-local light/dark palettes. See [Frontend themes and color](frontend-theming.md) for consumer rules, imperative renderer integration, semantic token changes, and the recommended plugin workflow for creating a selectable theme.

Localized frontend changes also update and validate the shared App/UI Lingui catalog:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/app i18n:extract
bun run localization:check
```

`i18n:extract` is App-owned because `packages/app/lingui.config.ts` includes both `packages/app/src` and `packages/ui/src`. The single root `localization:check` gate re-extracts catalogs and rejects drift, rejects missing or blank Simplified Chinese translations, strictly compiles every locale, then enforces the App/UI source contract for hard-coded visible strings, Chinese source literals, hard-coded locale tags, invalid descriptors, dynamic IDs, and Lingui macro imports. Keep tracked PO catalogs unchanged after extraction before handing off a localization change.

Write behavior tests around public invariants. Avoid source-text assertions that fail when an implementation is refactored without changing behavior.

## Quality Commands

```bash
bun run format:check
./script/format.ts
bun run lint
bun run lint:fix
bun run typecheck
bun run deadcode
bun run monorepo:check
bun run workflow:check
bun run secrets:check
bun run package:check
bun run test-layout:check
bun run quality:quick
bun run quality
```

`quality:quick` is the default local PR preflight: format, lint, Skill/package-guide/test-layout checks, strict localization contract, typecheck, monorepo consistency, and package validation. `quality` adds all Turbo tests. The pre-push hook runs Bun-version, format, lint, typecheck, and monorepo checks; CI runs the wider matrix.

See [Open-source quality](../operations/open-source-quality.md) for exact jobs and failure guidance.

## SDK and Builds

After modifying server routes or OpenAPI-visible schemas:

```bash
./script/generate.ts
```

Build the core single binary/runtime artifact with:

```bash
./packages/synergy/script/build.ts --single
```

The build validates and embeds the pinned `test/tool/fixtures/models-api.json` catalog before compiling. Use `MODELS_DEV_API_JSON=/path/to/models.json` only for a deliberate local build override; release workflows ignore that override and embed the repository snapshot.

Frontend code should use `createSynergyClient()` and generated methods for internal routes. Raw browser transports remain appropriate for WebSocket/EventSource streams, external URLs, browser file/blob handling, and endpoints whose semantics cannot be represented by the SDK.

## Repository Workflow

The development branch is `dev`; `main` is updated by the release workflow. All pull requests target `dev`.

Repository changes may be made directly in the current checkout. Treat primary and pre-existing checkouts as potentially shared: preserve unrelated work, and do not switch branches or rebase unless the user explicitly requests it. Use a task-owned worktree when concurrent development needs branch or file isolation, not as a prerequisite for every edit, and reuse an existing task worktree when it already owns the branch.

Stage and commit only when requested. Local commits on `dev` or `main` are allowed, but never push either protected branch directly. Push a topic branch and open its pull request against `dev`; the release workflow is the only path from `dev` to `main`. Preserve unrelated changes, stage explicit task files, and keep local paths, runtime identifiers, logs, credentials, and internal configuration out of commit and GitHub text. See `git-guide` for the commit template, mandatory agent co-author footer, and publication workflow.

Keep changes focused, update migrations for persisted schema changes, and update current-state docs plus relevant `.synergy/skill` workflows whenever an agent-facing command, path, tool, or procedure changes.

### Development workflow ownership

The repository-local `.synergy/skill/` directory is the executable handbook for changing Synergy itself. It is distinct from user-installed Skills and public plugin documentation.

When implementation or review reveals a reusable required pattern, registration, safety constraint, or verification step, update the owning Skill in the same change. Create a focused verb-led Skill if no existing workflow would reliably trigger. Root and package `AGENTS.md` files retain safety, global invariants, and routing; canonical docs retain product and architecture truth; Skills retain the executable procedure.

## Area-Specific Checks

- Server route/schema: regenerate SDK, typecheck runtime and SDK, run affected route tests.
- Session/message loop: read the session and frontend-sync contracts, run focused session tests, then shared checks.
- Frontend: typecheck `packages/app`, run relevant UI tests, preserve generated SDK usage and `PRODUCT.md` principles.
- Desktop/release: run Desktop typecheck/tests/build validation and review the Desktop release runbook.
- Plugin/public package: build package, run `package:check`, and verify exported ESM/type paths.
- Config/auth examples: run secret scanning and verify both global and project configuration behavior.
