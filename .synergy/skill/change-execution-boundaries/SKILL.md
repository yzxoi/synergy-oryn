description: Add, modify, or review Synergy capability classification, control profiles, permission rules, SmartAllow eligibility, workspace and sensitive-path policy, tool enforcement, or macOS/Linux/Windows sandbox behavior. Use for packages/synergy/src/control-profile, enforcement, permission, sandbox, session/tool-resolver, or shared capability definitions.

# Change Execution Boundaries

## Trace the Whole Decision

1. Read [Execution boundaries](../../../docs/architecture/execution-boundaries.md) and `packages/synergy/AGENTS.md`.
2. Start at `session/tool-resolver.ts`, then trace the operation through capability classification, the enforcement gate, profile compilation, saved/session permission layers, SmartAllow, approval side effects, sandbox policy, and the tool implementation.
3. Inspect `packages/util/src/capability.ts` for the shared capability catalog and public severity/category metadata. Keep classification independent from profile policy: classifiers describe what an operation can do; profiles decide allow, ask, or deny.
4. Check built-in tools, plugin and MCP envelopes, worktree/main-checkout reclassification, sensitive paths, remote execution, and platform fallback before assuming one call site owns the boundary.

## Preserve the Security Model

1. Route every executable path through the centralized gate. Do not move authorization into one tool or treat visibility, authorization, and sandboxing as the same decision.
2. Keep model presentation and execution separate. `ToolCatalog` sent to an Agent worker contains only serializable schemas; executable callbacks and permission state remain in the Control Plane and enter `ToolScheduler` only after the Agent stream is disposed.
3. Keep production capability analysis in the bounded Policy worker pool. The worker receives immutable classification context and returns capabilities; profile decisions, approvals, audit state, sandbox accumulation, and execution remain in the Control Plane. Await a bounded worker handshake before admission, and turn worker infrastructure failure into a direct conservative denial rather than an approval request.
4. Make classification termination explicit. A parser or classifier must share one time/depth/active-input budget and return a finite conservative capability on no progress, repeated input, or excessive depth. It must never restart its public top-level entry point to handle those conditions.
5. Keep `guarded` interactive, `autonomous` non-prompting, and `full_access` permission-silent without suppressing ordinary runtime failures.
6. Mark hard boundaries non-bypassable at the capability definition or classification source. SmartAllow and preauthorization must not override hard denials or receive raw secrets.
7. Keep the active workspace as the default write/execute boundary. Preserve original-checkout and sibling-worktree protection, trusted-root containment, protected metadata, and credential-path rules.
8. Treat sandboxing as post-authorization containment. Preserve filesystem roots, network mode, approved external roots, shell-bypass semantics, and the configured `deny`/`warn`/`allow` fallback.
9. Change platform helpers and TypeScript policy together. Do not claim parity without the relevant macOS Seatbelt, Linux helper/Bubblewrap, Windows helper, or WSL evidence.

## Implement and Verify

1. Write the failing behavioral test at the lowest owner: pure classifier, profile decision, permission layering, gate envelope, sandbox policy, or platform dispatch.
2. When adding or changing a capability, update its shared definition, risk/non-bypassable metadata, every classifier and manifest mapping, permission presentation, and focused tests.
3. When changing dispatch location or executor class, update `ToolExecutor.classify()`, per-executor admission tests, cancellation/failure containment tests, and the execution-boundary documentation. Executor classification is scheduling metadata and cannot replace capability classification.
4. Test both positive and adversarial forms, including argument aliases, shell wrappers, compound-operator lexical parity, no-progress/depth/repetition termination, external/protected paths, main checkout versus worktree, saved deny precedence, autonomous ask-to-deny behavior, Policy worker handshake/timeout/crash/replacement, non-interactive conservative fallback across every profile, sandbox-unavailable fallback, queue saturation, duplicate call identity, and executor crash/cancellation.
5. Run focused suites under `test/control-profile`, `test/enforcement`, `test/permission`, `test/sandbox`, `test/session`, and `test/workspace` as applicable, then typecheck and `bun run quality:quick`.
6. Use `develop-synergy` for platform or end-to-end shell verification. Never experiment against the runtime carrying the current task.
7. For packaged Linux or Windows sandboxes, build helpers per supported OS, architecture, and ABI before compiling the runtime. Embed the matching helper digest, fail a Stable build when an asset is missing, preserve the helper through every installer/package layout, and validate the installed artifact rather than only the source build.

For per-workload quotas, supply Host-owned resource requirements to the existing ToolScheduler before execution; do not wait on a second semaphore after occupying a tool slot. Register physical completion when the resolver can settle cancellation earlier than process cleanup, and verify that capacity remains held until that completion. These counters are admission limits, not OS isolation or cgroup accounting.

For command runners, reuse `SandboxBackend.executeAsync` with the authorized wrapper and the existing process ownership helpers. Verify combined output/callback limits, continued draining, pre-abort, pending-hook cancellation, descendant termination, and error-path cleanup. An unwrapped invocation and an environment allowlist do not establish OS isolation; describe and test wrapper preparation separately.

Update the architecture document when the pipeline, profile semantics, capability contract, workspace boundary, or sandbox guarantee changes. Update `git-guide`, `add-tool`, or `change-plugin-runtime` when their executable workflow depends on the new classification.

## Handoff

Report the capability and risk, classifier, profile decisions, bypassability, permission/SmartAllow behavior, sandbox policy and platform coverage, workspace effects, tests, and documentation synchronized.

For explicit Host permission profiles, verify the final platform input rather than only wrapper availability. Do not merge interactive user-home allowances into a restricted runner. Exercise read-only source, writable scratch, symlink escape, loopback denial and unsupported backend rejection with real child processes. A Linux two-stage helper must retain read-only access to its own executable and policy after private-root and temporary mounts; mount those individual bootstrap files, not their parent directories.

For Host-selected shell policies, resolve them after centralized authorization and reject remote/custom executor substitution before invocation. Revalidate assignment ownership at preparation, test real Git inspection without host configuration, and bind disposable roots to physical process cleanup across foreground and background results. A subprocess that ignores SIGTERM must stop writing before its finished record becomes visible; immediate parent exit or a sent signal is insufficient evidence. Explicit macOS profiles may grant ancestor metadata for traversal without granting parent directory listings or data reads.

When granting worker access to process control, persist Host-supplied ownership in both running and finished registry entries. Test list filtering and every direct-ID action against foreign and unowned processes, including remote/custom executor substitution. Keep stale-PID settlement and kill/remove behind the executor's physical completion promise; test an exited parent while artifact cleanup is deliberately pending. Do not infer process ownership from cwd or treat visibility filtering as authorization.

For workflow stop operations, persist inactive state before signalling execution and suppress Session admission, inference and Inbox wake from that state. Drain physical built-in callbacks as well as prompt-facing promises; test cancellation while shell preparation is deliberately held and assert no late spawn. Avoid waiting for a control lock inside a callback that its owner must drain. Keep QA ownership separate and state precisely whether resume supports queued tasks, consumed turns or replacement epochs.
