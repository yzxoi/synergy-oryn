# Test Synergy Behavior

## Define the Invariant First

1. State the observable contract and the failure that would violate it.
2. For a bug or new behavior, write the smallest failing test before the implementation. Skip a new test only for a pure refactor whose existing tests already cover unchanged behavior.
3. Assert public results, state transitions, emitted contracts, permissions, or recovery behavior. Avoid source-text assertions, private call counts, and snapshots of irrelevant structure.

For non-blocking and ordering contracts, hold the downstream operation behind an explicit promise and assert the upstream result while it remains pending. When asserting that an inbox item remains queued after an operation that schedules a wake, hold a real SessionManager loop lease on the worker; clean up its queued work before releasing the lease so a delayed wake cannot escape the fixture. Use a generous test-framework timeout only to detect deadlocks, release the barrier in cleanup, and avoid wall-clock performance thresholds in instrumented correctness suites. Do not wrap correctness-only completion signals in shorter `Promise.race` timers: filesystem and worktree startup contention can exceed those incidental budgets on CI.

## Choose the Lowest Useful Level

- pure function/schema: inline data and direct calls
- tool/domain behavior: real implementation plus isolated temp directory and Scope context
- persistence/migration: real storage, fresh-install and upgrade fixtures, restart/readback where relevant
- route/SDK: call the route or generated client contract
- session/LLM loop: real session state with deterministic provider/model fixtures
- Web/UI: component/context behavior plus the smallest browser or integration check needed
- package/release: build, pack, and validate the published artifact rather than source layout alone

Inspect two nearby tests and `packages/synergy/test/preload.ts` before introducing a new harness pattern.

Place every test under the owning package's `test/` directory, mirroring the relevant source domain when that helps navigation. Place repository-level script and policy tests under the root `test/` directory. Never cascade `*.test.*` or `*.spec.*` files beside implementation files in `src/`, `script/`, or another source directory. Run `bun run test-layout:check` when adding or moving tests.

For localized UI behavior, use a real Lingui `I18nProvider` with minimal English and Simplified Chinese messages. Assert visible text and accessibility labels after a reactive locale change; do not mock translation calls to return IDs because that hides missing catalogs and stale module-load translations. Keep plugin-author, user, LLM, path, identifier, and raw-error pass-through in the same boundary test as translated host chrome.

## Use Real Isolation

Use `tmpdir()` and `ScopeContext` instead of mocking Storage, Session, or the filesystem. The preload-managed `SYNERGY_TEST_ROOT` contains temporary fixtures for process-level cleanup, so do not move fixtures back to unmanaged operating-system temp paths or delete them while Scope-owned asynchronous work may still reference them. Restore environment variables and singleton state in cleanup hooks. A module-level replacement of a process global — `globalThis.fetch` above all — is visible to every sibling file in the same shard process: capture the original before installing the replacement and restore it in `afterAll`, because a per-test `finally` that re-reads `globalThis.fetch` restores the replacement, not the original. Honor abort signals and dispose processes, Browser pages, servers, and timers.

Provider/model tests rely on `test/preload.ts` to seed the model catalog. The preload writes the pinned `test/tool/fixtures/models-api.json` fixture to `cache/models.json` under `SYNERGY_TEST_HOME` so the runtime disk-cache path resolves deterministically, sets `MODELS_DEV_API_JSON` to that cached path so the build-time macro and direct macro tests resolve the same fixture, and sets `SYNERGY_DISABLE_MODELS_FETCH=true` to suppress background network refresh. Update the fixture deliberately; never make deterministic tests depend on the live model catalog or real API keys.

Core binary builds also default to that pinned fixture. Test build behavior through `script/models-catalog.ts`: the selected catalog must satisfy the runtime schema and contain non-empty OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google providers before compilation. Ordinary local builds may use `MODELS_DEV_API_JSON` as an explicit override; release builds must force the repository-pinned snapshot so network and build-machine cache state cannot alter the artifact.

Tests that exercise the cold-cache path — where no disk or memory cache exists — must spawn a fresh Bun subprocess with a clean isolated home directory. The Bun preloader populates process-global state for the test harness, so the existing process always has a warm cache. A cold-cache test strips `SYNERGY_TEST_HOME` and `MODELS_DEV_API_JSON` from the child environment, sets `SYNERGY_HOME` to a fresh temp directory, and asserts against the child process output.

Use a fake or local boundary only where the external system is not the subject of the test. Do not add Jest/Vitest mocks to the Bun suite without an established package-specific reason.

Playwright DOM-test fixtures that boot a Vite dev server must declare their package prerequisites: published Plugin entries use the root coverage command’s dependency build; alias other workspace-package entries whose `import` condition points at gitignored `dist/` output to their source entry when the fixture tests source behavior; resolve runtime packages that break under dependency pre-bundling (Lingui's `@messageformat/parser` chain) to minimal fixture-local stubs when the suite asserts behavior unrelated to i18n rendering, or add them to `optimizeDeps.include` when the real runtime is the subject; set `optimizeDeps.include` for the Solid runtime/JSX runtime/zod with `noDiscovery: true` so the optimizer never re-runs mid-load and reloads the page; scope `cacheDir` to the fixture temp directory so sibling Playwright servers sharing `node_modules/.vite` cannot invalidate each other; `warmupRequest` the fixture entry before launching the browser and surface page/console/HTTP errors in the failure message instead of a bare 30s selector timeout; and register the suite in the package's `playwrightIsolated` list so bun's worker reaping cannot kill its Chromium process mid-suite. See the [hermetic Vite fixtures decision](../../../docs/decisions/implemented/testing/2026-08-31-hermetic-vite-fixtures-for-playwright-dom-tests.md). Root production-host UI acceptance follows the same process isolation: run `bun run plugin-ui:test`, which starts one Bun process per suite in sequence, instead of passing the entire browser directory to `bun test`.

## Run Core Suites Through the Orchestrators

Run `packages/synergy` tests through the package scripts, never a raw `bun test --coverage --parallel`:

```bash
cd packages/synergy
bun test test/<domain>/<file>.test.ts
bun run test:ci
bun run test:coverage
```

`test:ci` and `test:coverage` spawn every Bun child with an injected `SYNERGY_TEST_HOME`/`SYNERGY_TEST_ROOT` and no `SYNERGY_HOME`, because Bun 1.3.x does not propagate `test/preload.ts` environment into `--parallel` worker processes — a raw parallel/coverage run falls through to the real user home and writes fixtures into `~/.synergy/data`.

`src/global/index.ts` enforces this at module load: a test-entry process (`Bun.main`/argv matching `*.test.*`/`*.spec.*`, or `BUN_TEST_WORKER_ID`/`JEST_WORKER_ID` present) must carry the positive `SYNERGY_TEST_HOME` isolation marker, and is additionally blocked when the root is `os.homedir()/.synergy` or inside it (Windows paths normalized case-insensitively). If you see `TestHomeGuardError`, the run bypassed isolation: re-run through the package scripts or set `SYNERGY_TEST_HOME` to a dedicated test home. `SYNERGY_ALLOW_REAL_HOME=1` is the only escape hatch for a deliberate real-home run.

## Run Narrow to Broad

Core runtime commands run from `packages/synergy`:

```bash
bun test test/<domain>/<file>.test.ts
bun run test:changed
bun test
bun run test:ci
bun run test:coverage
```

Repository gates run from the root:

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun run quality:quick
bun turbo test
bun run quality
```

Localized frontend changes also run:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/app i18n:extract
bun run localization:check
bun run --cwd packages/app build
```

Extraction must leave tracked PO catalogs unchanged, strict compilation must reject missing Simplified Chinese or invalid ICU messages, and the production build must keep non-English catalogs lazy while excluding development-only pseudo-localization. Exercise a Chinese cold start, rapid switching, catalog-load failure, `html.lang`, keyboard labels, and 375 px layout through an isolated Web/Desktop runtime.

Run the narrow failing test during iteration, then the affected package/domain suite, then `quality:quick`. Run the full suite when the change crosses shared abstractions, persistence, generated contracts, package publication, or release boundaries, or when the user requests it.

`bun run test:ci` is the CI-equivalent core suite. It runs four shards sequentially in fresh Bun processes to bound process-global state and fixture accumulation without introducing cross-shard port or environment races. Set `SYNERGY_TEST_JUNIT_DIR` to emit one JUnit report per shard.

Coverage has a floor. `bun run coverage:check` enforces per-package line/function thresholds (the only metrics Bun 1.3.14 exposes in lcov) with an auditable exemption list in `script/coverage-exempt.json`. The rules:

- Cover product logic with real behavioral tests before exempting anything.
- Assert the complete asynchronous state being tested, not the first intermediate event. For time-budgeted maintenance, drive deferred passes through the public maintenance operation before asserting the final cap; preserve a bounded overall deadline.
- Register each new workspace package in `script/coverage-exempt.json` with a coverage command and thresholds. When adding nested test directories, verify that the package's coverage command includes them as well as its ordinary test command.
- Every exemption entry carries a `reason`; entries that match nothing, overlap, or cover more than 25% of a package fail validation.
- Bun 1.3.14 supports no ignore comments (`istanbul ignore`, `v8 ignore`, and `c8 ignore` are all inert), so whole-file exemption is the only exclusion mechanism. Do not add ignore comments expecting them to work.
- A source file never loaded by any test counts as 0% and fails the package — add a real test that loads it rather than exempting blindly.
- For Solid wrappers exercised through a Vite-compiled DOM fixture, verify whether Bun attributes coverage to the emitted bundle instead of the TSX source. An exact-file exemption must identify the behavioral suite and this instrumentation boundary; keep directly testable logic measured separately.

Use [Development reference](../../../docs/reference/development.md) and [Open-source quality](../../../docs/operations/open-source-quality.md) for current command ownership. Do not invent a root `bun test`; the root script intentionally rejects that ambiguous command.

## Diagnose Failures

1. Re-run the narrow test alone and capture the first causal failure.
2. Check isolation leaks, stale generated files, timeouts, open handles, environment restoration, ordering, and platform assumptions.
3. Distinguish a product regression from a brittle expectation. Change the test only when the intended public contract is wrong or was asserted at the wrong level.
4. Do not skip, weaken, or quarantine a relevant test merely to make the gate green.

## Handoff

Report the invariant, test location, red/green evidence, commands run, pass/fail counts, unrun gates, platform limitations, and any remaining nondeterminism.

The root `coverage:check` command builds the public Plugin package through the dependency graph before instrumented suites run. Browser fixtures and Plugin Kit scaffolds resolve the published `import` entries; a clean checkout must not rely on artifacts left by another test or package-validation job.
