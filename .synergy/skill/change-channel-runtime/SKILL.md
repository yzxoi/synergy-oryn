# Change the Channel Runtime

## Trace the Contract

1. Read [Channels](../../../docs/architecture/channels.md), [Sessions and messages](../../../docs/architecture/session-and-messages.md), [Connections](../../../docs/product/connections.md), and the nearest package `AGENTS.md` files.
2. Identify the provider's conversation, Project, and Task ingress capabilities independently, and classify its lifecycle as `self_connected` or `borrowed_transport`.
3. Trace target identity, provider configuration, account start/stop/status, `ChannelHost`, managed ownership, Session endpoint lookup, inbox delivery, navigation projection, routes, generated SDK consumers, diagnostics, and recovery state.
4. Load `change-persistence` for ownership, indexes, provider-private state, or outboxes; `change-server-api` for routes or generated contracts; `develop-frontend` for account/navigation UI; `add-tool` for first-party Channel tools; and `develop-synergy` for isolated runtime verification.

## GitHub Channel Provider

The `github` provider (`packages/synergy/src/channel/provider/github/`) connects a GitHub App installation as a conversation channel. It is `self_connected` and polls the GitHub REST API outbound — no inbound webhook.

- **Conversation ingress only** — synthesized repository events (`issue.opened`, `pull_request.opened`, `pull_request.synchronize`, `comment.created`) flow through `ChannelHost.conversations.receive()` with `chatId = "owner/repo#<number>"`.
- **Per-thread Scope** — implement `resolveConversationScope()` to bind each thread to its own random-hash checkout directory (see `GithubChannelWorkspace.ensure()`), so sessions are isolated per issue/PR. `workspaceDir` is configured per account.
- **Mention gating** — comments only wake an agent on an explicit `@synergy-agent` mention (`gateGithubEvent`); `autoReview`/`autoRespond` account toggles gate PR and issue events.
- **Reactions** — `addReaction` maps the generic channel emoji vocabulary onto GitHub's reaction content set (`eyes`/`rocket`/`confused`/`+1`/`-1`/`laugh`/`hooray`/`heart`) via a comment→chatId registry populated by the poll loop; unsupported emoji are skipped.
- **Agent** — `github-channel-agent` owns all GitHub sessions; `gh`, `git push`, and `git remote` are denied (the provider performs all GitHub writes with an installation token).
- **Credentials** — `SYNERGY_GITHUB_APP_ID` / `SYNERGY_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` env-only; distinct from the user-credential `src/provider/github.ts` (bash `GH_TOKEN` injection).

Preserve these invariants when changing the provider: deterministic per-thread directory resolution, `@synergy-agent` mention gating, comment→chatId reaction registry, and the env-only credential boundary.

## Preserve Ownership

1. Keep Scope and Session creation in Channel core. A project/task-capable provider reports remote facts through `ChannelHost`; it does not call Scope, Session, or model execution directly.
2. Use typed `ChannelTarget` identity for new chat, Project, and Task endpoints. Preserve existing Feishu legacy endpoint keys, default Home-Scope behavior, and configured project Scope routing byte-for-byte.
3. Keep Project targets as ownership/navigation identity only. Discovery and Project-level events must not create a Project conversation Session or invoke a model.
4. Map each external Project identity to one canonical managed Project Scope with hashed forward and reverse ownership indexes. Keep raw external IDs out of path components, reject path escape and symbolic links, keep the managed workspace non-Git, and never remove a Scope in response to remote archive.
5. Map one external Task ID to one stable unattended Session in its managed Project Scope. Deliver assignments and updates through the persistent inbox with deterministic delivery keys; keep participation and deadline guidance hidden and system-authored.

## Preserve Native Clarus Semantics

1. Borrow the existing authenticated Holos Agent Tunnel through `HolosRuntime.getNativeTunnel()`. Do not add another WebSocket, transport reconnect loop, credential owner, daemon, or Holos server change. Provider initialization may retry through Channel's bounded backoff after borrowed transport readiness.
2. Validate account identity, process epoch, connection generation, event schemas, request correlation, and acknowledgement identity at the transport boundary. Dispose observers and in-flight work on account stop or transport replacement.
3. Clarus emits only Project and Task ingress. Treat `clarus.project.membership.accepted` only as a hint to repeat authoritative Project discovery and correlated subscription; never grant ownership from that payload or from an Assignment `project_id`. Keep subscription state and runtime Task events as the remaining accepted event families, and classify legacy Project message, file, system, and notary events as unknown without Session delivery.
4. If Task dispatch reports missing managed ownership, allow one bounded authoritative Project refresh and one retry while preserving `ChannelHostProjectNotOwnedError` and the archive guard. Do not create a Scope or Session from Assignment identity alone.
5. Send `clarus.runtime.task.accept` only after preflight, Session binding, assignment persistence, and deadline synchronization, immediately before first wake. Persist `acceptState`, stable `acceptRequestID`, and `acceptedAt` on the existing Assignment record; parse old records with `acceptState: none` and do not add a migration or outbox. Exact replay must validate managed ownership, the bound non-archived Session, and request/run/Project/Task/subtask/attempt identity before bypassing `ChannelHost.dispatch`: acknowledged replay is a full local no-op, live pending replay sends nothing, and ambiguous or orphaned persisted pending replay only resends accept with the same request ID. Let correlated `runtimeTaskAccepted` bypass generic in-flight suppression and settle only on matching request ID plus all five task identity fields. Late acknowledgement may upgrade ambiguous state, and acknowledged state must never regress on transport failure.
6. Persist result and extension outbox records before dispatch. Only `not_dispatched` may retry automatically with a fresh request ID and lineage; `rejected`, `ambiguous`, and `acknowledged` are terminal for automatic retry. Recovered `pending` records become `ambiguous`.
7. Keep remote Project pause as display/protocol state for already accepted work. Use the standard Session Abort path for local cancellation, and keep accepted-task result, extension, and deadline behavior available while remotely paused.
8. Use Agenda `session_guidance` only for durable hidden steering into the owning Task Session. Clarus deadline guidance fires once exactly three minutes before the current deadline, fires as soon as safely possible when less time remains, does nothing after expiry, and reuses the same Agenda item after an acknowledged or authoritative extension. It must not create an Agenda execution Session or a visible fake user prompt.
9. Keep `clarus-agent-participation` available as a memory-backed builtin Skill in a fresh `SYNERGY_HOME`. Its content must describe only the native assignment Session and result/extension tools; do not bundle standalone listener, CLI, daemon, credential, or second-WebSocket workflows.

## Keep API and Product Projection Complete

1. Add precise route schemas and OpenAPI metadata for Channel account actions, then regenerate the SDK and migrate ordinary Web calls to generated methods. Keep diagnostics downloads on the established file/blob path.
2. Bound and redact durable diagnostics before persistence and export. Never expose credentials, auth headers, raw local paths, or unbounded prompt/result payloads.
3. Project managed Projects once under the owning Channel account from canonical Scope/Session navigation state. Do not add a provider-specific Project store, duplicate generic Projects, or a dedicated Clarus hierarchy.
4. Present provider-capability actions, account and remote Project states, semantic icons, keyboard access, localized labels, and archive-guard guidance through shared components.
5. Update [Channels](../../../docs/architecture/channels.md), product connection/workspace docs, storage paths, and `packages/app/PRODUCT.md` when their contracts change.

## Verify

1. Write the smallest failing behavioral test first. Use real temporary Scope, Storage, Session, inbox, Agenda, and filesystem state; fake only Holos/Clarus network boundaries.
   For Oryn conversation changes, use `test/oryn/fixtures/feishu.ts` with real `ChannelHost.conversations.receive()`, tool parsing, Inbox and outbound events. A direct service call cannot prove agent selection, per-root reply targeting, or silent foreground/background delivery; include these paths and label synthetic model output separately from a live canary.
2. When Channel behavior depends on Scope-local subscriptions, cover both the first account connection and `ScopeRuntime.dispose()` followed by `ScopeRuntime.ensure()`; an active account must rebind its bridges exactly once before startup recovery can terminalize pending Channel messages, so recovery-time events are delivered rather than lost.
3. Run the focused Channel, Holos native tunnel, Session endpoint/navigation, Agenda guidance, tool, server route, and frontend account/navigation tests affected by the change.
4. Run `bun test test/channel/` and the relevant Holos, Agenda, Session, tool, and server suites from `packages/synergy`; preserve Feishu compatibility coverage.
5. For route changes, run `./script/generate.ts` twice and confirm generated OpenAPI/SDK output is stable. Run App/UI tests, localization checks, typecheck, build, Skill validation, and `bun run quality:quick` as applicable.
6. Exercise the protocol in an isolated second runtime with a separate `SYNERGY_HOME` and explicit ports. Verify disabled and zero-Project idle behavior, discovery, one Task Session per Task ID, result/extension settlement, reconnect recovery, diagnostics download, and cleanup without using the active runtime.
