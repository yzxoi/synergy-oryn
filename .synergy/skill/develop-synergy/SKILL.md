description: Run and test a source checkout of Synergy in an isolated second runtime without stopping or modifying the active Synergy instance. Use for source development, end-to-end verification, alternate branches/worktrees, bun dev web or desktop, managed Desktop testing, port conflicts, and SYNERGY_HOME isolation.

# Develop Synergy Safely

## Protect the Active Runtime

Never stop, restart, signal, or reuse the `SYNERGY_HOME` of the Synergy instance carrying the current task. Do not run `synergy stop`, broad `kill`/`pkill`, or modify its data/lock files.

Read [Development reference](../../../docs/reference/development.md) before choosing a mode.

## Prepare an Isolated Home

1. Choose a dedicated parent directory and explicit free ports. Check listeners with `lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN` or the platform equivalent; do not assume `4097` and `3001` are free.
2. Create the required `.synergy` parent and copy configuration:

```bash
DEV_HOME=/tmp/synergy-dev-<short-name>
mkdir -p "$DEV_HOME/.synergy"
cp -R ~/.synergy/config "$DEV_HOME/.synergy/config"
```

3. Copying configuration preserves provider settings but does not copy the separate credential store. Do not copy sessions, daemon state, locks, logs, cache, or Library data — the two model catalog files in step 4 are the sole cache exception. Seed only the fixture credentials a test requires inside the isolated home; never copy or overwrite the live credential store implicitly.
4. Copy model catalog data from the main home when the isolated environment cannot reach models.dev (offline or restricted-network debugging machines), so the isolated model list does not depend on a live models.dev fetch:

```bash
mkdir -p "$DEV_HOME/.synergy/cache"
for f in provider-model-catalogs.v1.json models.json; do cp ~/.synergy/cache/"$f" "$DEV_HOME/.synergy/cache/" 2>/dev/null || true; done
```

Treat these two cache files as seed data only: they are refreshed in place by the isolated runtime and never copied back to the main home. If the files are absent from the main home, the isolated instance will fetch models.dev on first use as usual.

5. Run `bun dev prepare` once when dependencies, generated SDK, Web dist, plugin SDK, or sandbox helper are missing.

## Choose the Smallest Mode

```bash
SYNERGY_HOME="$DEV_HOME" bun dev server --port 4097
SYNERGY_HOME="$DEV_HOME" bun dev app --attach http://127.0.0.1:4097 --port 3001
SYNERGY_HOME="$DEV_HOME" bun dev web --server-port 4097 --app-port 3001
SYNERGY_HOME="$DEV_HOME" bun dev desktop --server-port 4097 --app-port 3001
SYNERGY_HOME="$DEV_HOME" bun dev desktop --managed --server-port 4097 --app-port 3001
SYNERGY_HOME="$DEV_HOME" bun dev send "test request"
```

Development modes bind to loopback by default. To expose an isolated Web stack deliberately, bind both the source server and Vite app with the shared hostname flag:

```bash
SYNERGY_HOME="$DEV_HOME" bun dev web --hostname 0.0.0.0 --server-port 4097 --app-port 3001
```

Use `server` for backend/CLI work, `web` for normal full-stack work, `desktop` for Electron-native behavior, and `desktop --managed` for the production-style managed-server path. Managed mode rebuilds the Web distribution before launch.

Development process lifecycle is owned by the root orchestrator. Both serial build-and-run workflows and parallel workflows tag their descendants at spawn time so cleanup can recover nested process groups even after package wrappers exit. A managed Desktop server arms parent-process liveness monitoring before startup becomes healthy and shuts down if its Electron parent disappears, because forced application termination cannot run Electron quit handlers.

Managed Desktop captures the user's login-shell `PATH` once and passes only its normalized value to the managed server, preserving inherited absolute entries as fallbacks. It does not import arbitrary profile variables. Verify the effective value and fixed command resolutions in developer-mode Settings → Observability; a Desktop-process source indicates that the login-shell probe safely fell back. Do not replace this startup boundary by making Bash tool execution use a login shell: Bash remains ordinary `shell -c` under the sandbox environment allowlist.

## Preserve Desktop Renderer Lifecycle

Route main-process broadcasts for the application renderer through `DesktopRendererDelivery`. A live `BrowserWindow` or `WebContents` does not prove that its current main frame can receive IPC during startup, document navigation, reload, renderer exit, or shutdown.

- Restore delivery only from the trusted `desktop.startup.appReady` handshake; let main-frame navigation, renderer exit, and destruction invalidate it.
- Use `sendLatest()` for replaceable snapshots such as window, theme, and update state; use `enqueue()` for one-shot messages such as deep links; use `send()` for transient events that should be dropped while the renderer is unavailable.
- Keep startup-overlay updates on the overlay's own `WebContentsView`; it is not the application renderer.
- Cover pre-ready, main-frame reload, post-ready convergence, destroyed/detached frame, and renderer-exit behavior before running an isolated Desktop cold-start and reload check.
- Keep renderer window-state broadcasts disabled on macOS. Native fullscreen moves the window across Spaces asynchronously and can emit unstable focus/fullscreen transitions; macOS uses native chrome and should query state explicitly when needed.

## Verify and Diagnose

1. Confirm health on the selected server port before opening dependent clients.
2. Reproduce the behavior with a new isolated Scope/session. Record only redacted IDs and project-relative evidence in shareable output.
3. Use `SYNERGY_HOME="$DEV_HOME" synergy logs --dev`, `status --verbose`, or `diagnostics` against the isolated environment. Never inspect the main runtime by accident.
4. Restart only the isolated process when server or Desktop main-process code changes; Vite handles Web hot reload.
5. Run narrow automated tests and `bun run quality:quick` independently of the manual instance.

For managed startup changes, test a fresh home and an isolated upgrade lasting longer than the ordinary health deadline. Verify advancing migration counts renew the wait, duplicate counts and ordinary logs do not, stalled work fails with its last progress, and migration completion restores the health deadline. Run `SYNERGY_DESKTOP_RUNTIME_TEST=1 bun test test/startup-progress-runtime.test.ts` from `packages/desktop` to check the actual progress DOM in Electron. Keep startup progress aggregate-only and report it before awaiting long migration work.

For CLI migration progress, exercise both foreground server and local `send --format json` startup. Keep human progress on stderr, display the step before its first await, and preserve stdout for command results or machine protocols. Test TTY updates, redirected output, `NO_COLOR`, `TERM=dumb`, failure cleanup and retry; explicit silent migration callers remain silent.

## Clean Up

Terminate only PIDs launched for this isolated home. Verify the PID/port before signaling it. Remove the isolated directory only after its processes have exited and only when no evidence is needed.

## Handoff

Report the isolated home label without exposing secrets, chosen mode and ports, reproduction steps, observed result, logs/trace filters used, automated checks, and whether cleanup completed.

## Native Computer Verification

For macOS Computer changes, use an isolated Desktop user-data directory as well as `SYNERGY_HOME`. `SYNERGY_COMPUTER_DRIVER_PATH` may point to a verified development binary; production builds use the pinned driver. Exercise discovery, observation, a background action in a disposable native app, image delivery, profile denial, cancellation, and reconnect. Check the target app state and frontmost app independently; a successful input dispatch alone is insufficient. Never replace a missing OS grant with another application's authority.

For OS permission verification, launch the isolated app through macOS LaunchServices and inspect its actual permission state. A terminal-spawned Electron can inherit the terminal host's TCC responsibility, so a successful preflight does not establish that the standalone Desktop app has its own grants. Use a clearly named isolated app bundle; never modify another app's identity or reuse its grants to make a test pass.
