## Work that continues

AI agent work often outlives a single conversation. Synergy treats it as durable workspace state. A task can move between Web, Desktop, CLI, background execution, and specialist agents while preserving its project, history, files, tools, and operating context.

Synergy runs as a standalone local workspace. Connecting a Holos agent adds account identity, messaging, presence, and Synergy Link remote execution without replacing local projects, providers, sessions, or data.

## What makes Synergy different

- **Durable by default** — Keep recoverable sessions attached to an explicit home or project Scope, with complete history even when older model context is compacted.
- **One runtime, every surface** — Use the same sessions and state from the Web workbench, Desktop app, CLI, server API, and SDK.
- **First-class agent coordination** — Delegate to specialist subagents, plan durable Blueprints, run independently reviewed BlueprintLoops, keep focused work moving with Light Loop, or orchestrate a tree of persistent specialist workers with Boss Mode.
- **Files and Browser stay in context** — Work across project files and a session-owned Browser page without moving the task into a separate tool or disposable environment.
- **Knowledge compounds** — Retain reusable memory and learned experience in Library while authoring Notes and Blueprints as durable documents.
- **Local-first and extensible** — Add providers, tools, Skills, commands, MCP servers, plugins, Channels, and remote Synergy Link targets while keeping local ownership of projects and data.

Read the [product overview](docs/product/overview.md) for the complete product model, including Lattice Pathways, Agenda, Channels, Library, Holos, and extension boundaries.

|   **Notes** — agents write durable notes and Blueprints as they work, searchable and scoped per project.   |        **Plugins** — extend Synergy with skills, tools, and UI from the official and local registries.         |

## Benchmarks

On the [DeepSWE v1.1](https://deepswe.datacurve.ai) benchmark — 113 real repository engineering tasks — the same model completes far more work under Synergy than under its stock harness. Running deepseek-v4-flash with the **synergy-max** agent lifts Pass@1 from **53% to 67.3%** (+14.3pp, 1.27×) at **$0.54/task**, landing on the cost-performance Pareto front.

Methodology: official leaderboard numbers from deepswe.datacurve.ai (v1.1, fetched 2026-08-22); Synergy numbers from local full-benchmark runs. All costs are computed at the API prices in effect **before** 2026-08-17 00:00 (Beijing time) — **prior to** DeepSeek's across-the-board price increase and peak/off-peak pricing.

## Quick Start

### Desktop

Download the latest installer from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SII-Holos/synergy/releases/latest). Desktop installers include the app and expose the packaged runtime as the `synergy` CLI.

| Platform | Installer   |
| -------- | ----------- |
| macOS    | `.pkg`      |
| Windows  | NSIS `.exe` |
| Linux    | `.deb`      |

Portable artifacts are also published, but they do not configure a system CLI. Windows Desktop and CLI releases currently support x64.

### CLI and Web

Install the current release:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SII-Holos/synergy/main/install | bash
```

Configure a model provider, start the background runtime, and open the Web client:

```bash
synergy config wizard
synergy start
synergy web
```

Run one task directly from the terminal:

```bash
synergy send "summarize this repository"
```

Useful runtime commands:

```bash
synergy status
synergy logs
synergy doctor
synergy stop
```

The CLI installer places the runtime, Web UI, and schema assets under `~/.synergy/`; setting `SYNERGY_HOME=/path` changes that root to `/path/.synergy/`. It does not install the Electron Desktop app.

You can keep one Synergy installation per channel — the standalone CLI, a supported package-manager install (`npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `bun`), and the Desktop app — but only one should be the `synergy` command your shell runs. `synergy doctor` lists every detected installation channel and exits nonzero when channels conflict or an installed version cannot be verified. The curl installer and the npm package postinstall warn about other channels they detect and never auto-uninstall them. Homebrew's `synergy` formula is unrelated to this project and is not detected or managed.

Upgrade with `synergy upgrade`, or install a specific version by passing `--version <version>` to the installer. When multiple channels are installed, `synergy upgrade` stops instead of guessing: rerun with `--method <npm|yarn|pnpm|bun|desktop|standalone>` to select an installed, healthy channel.

`synergy uninstall` keeps its existing defaults and removes data, cache, config, and state unless you pass `--keep-data` or `--keep-config`. To remove only one installation channel while preserving shared data, cache, config, and state, run `synergy uninstall --installation-only --method <channel>`; standalone removal deletes only installer-owned files under `~/.synergy/` and the exact shell PATH entries the installer wrote.

Headless Browser tools require Chromium. Run `synergy browser install` to install the verified managed version and `synergy browser doctor` to check readiness, or set `CHROMIUM_PATH` to a separately installed executable. Desktop Browser presentation uses Electron's bundled Chromium.

Holos is optional. Connect an agent from the Web account surface or run `synergy holos login`.

See the [CLI reference](docs/reference/cli.md), [configuration reference](docs/reference/configuration.md), and [release notes](https://github.com/SII-Holos/synergy/releases) for complete setup and runtime details.

## Oryn: feedback-to-PR automation

This repository hosts **Synergy Oryn**, a product configuration and runtime extension of Synergy that closes the loop from Feishu feedback to reviewable GitHub pull requests: a QA agent answers questions and files cases per chat thread, engineering cases run through reproduction, coding in isolated worktrees, independent verification, and independent review, and only fully gated results are delivered back to the reporter. Humans always perform the merge; Oryn never merges, releases, or force-pushes.

Oryn is dormant until explicitly enabled: set `oryn.enabled` (with routes and repository mappings) in the `120-runtime.jsonc` config domain. While disabled, all Synergy channel, Boss, Feishu, and GitHub behavior is unchanged.

Implementation status: the runtime roles (`oryn`, `oryn-work`, `oryn-repro`, `oryn-code`, `oryn-review`), the controlled `oryn_*` tool surface, case/attempt/evidence persistence, and the GitHub publishing path follow the [implementation proposal](docs/decisions/proposed/architecture/2026-09-07-synergy-oryn.md) with [research background](docs/research/2026-09-07-maintenance-automation-proposal.md) and the [developer handoff](docs/research/2026-09-07-synergy-oryn-handoff.md). Locally verifiable behavior is covered by tests under `packages/synergy/test/oryn/`; live Feishu canary, real GitHub App publishing, and VPS deployment verification remain pending environment acceptance and are not claimed complete.

## Develop Synergy

Synergy is a Bun monorepo using TypeScript ESM modules. The pinned package manager is declared in [`package.json`](package.json).

Prepare a source checkout:

```bash
bun dev prepare
```

Common development flows:

```bash
bun dev server
bun dev app --open
bun dev web
bun dev desktop
bun dev desktop --managed
bun dev send "your message"
```

Default local preflight:

```bash
bun run quality:quick
```

Core runtime tests run from `packages/synergy`:

```bash
cd packages/synergy
bun test
bun run test:ci # CI-equivalent sequential shards
```

Frontend package suites run through their standard scripts and are included in `bun run quality`:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/app test
bun run --cwd packages/ui test
```

Browser capability or App bootstrap changes also verify the source boundary and a genuine non-loopback HTTP origin:

```bash
bun test --cwd packages/app test/testing/browser-crypto-contract.test.ts
bun run --cwd packages/app build
bun packages/app/script/private-http-smoke.ts
```

Tests live under each package's `test/` directory; repository-level tests live under the root `test/` directory. `bun run quality:quick` enforces this layout.

Frontend product copy is extracted into English and Simplified Chinese catalogs, plus a development-only pseudo catalog. Changes to visible text or locale formatting also run:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/app i18n:extract
bun run localization:check
```

When developing Synergy while using Synergy itself, start an isolated second instance with a separate `SYNERGY_HOME` and explicit ports. Never stop or replace the instance hosting your active session. The [development reference](docs/reference/development.md) contains the complete workflow.

## Develop Plugins

Plugin authors can start without cloning this repository:

```bash
bunx @ericsanchezok/synergy-plugin-kit create my-plugin --template tool-ui
cd my-plugin
bun install
synergy-plugin build
synergy-plugin validate --runtime-discovery
```

Start with the [plugin documentation](docs/plugins/README.md) and the [`@ericsanchezok/synergy-plugin` API reference](packages/plugin/README.md).
