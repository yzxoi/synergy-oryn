# Synergy Plugin API 4

`definePlugin()` is the only source of plugin identity, capabilities, contributions, and executable handlers. Authors do not write `plugin.json`; `synergy-plugin build` generates it with runtime/UI bundles and integrity metadata.

```ts
import z from "zod"
import { capability, definePlugin, event, operation, workbenchPanel } from "@ericsanchezok/synergy-plugin"

export default definePlugin({
  id: "example",
  version: "1.0.0",
  description: "Example plugin",
  compatibility: { synergy: ">=3.0.11" },
  assets: [{ source: "src/prompts", target: "runtime/prompts" }],
  capabilities: [capability("workspace.read"), capability("ui.hostActions")],
  contributions: [
    event({ id: "example.changed", payload: z.object({ reason: z.string() }) }),
    operation({
      id: "example.get",
      type: "query",
      input: z.object({}),
      output: z.object({ scopeId: z.string() }),
      async handler(_input, context) {
        return { scopeId: context.scopeId }
      },
    }),
    workbenchPanel({
      id: "main",
      label: "Example",
      surface: "side",
      cardinality: "singleton",
      component: { source: "./src/ui.tsx" },
    }),
  ],
})
```

## Definition Rules

- Plugin IDs use lowercase letters, digits, dots, and hyphens and begin with a letter.
- Contribution IDs are unique within each contribution kind. A command operation and its `ui.textAction` may intentionally share a local ID; generated runtime handler IDs remain kind-qualified.
- A contribution's `requires` entries must exist in top-level `capabilities`.
- `operation()` defaults to `expose: ['ui']`; add `sdk` explicitly for public SDK access.
- Zod and JSON Schema are accepted for operation, event, and tool schemas.
- `activate()` runs once per runtime generation and does not receive Scope or Session state.
- Top-level `assets` map project-relative files or directories into package-relative targets. Asset contents are integrity-checked and included in the generation hash.
- The plugin and plugin-kit npm package versions follow the Synergy product release version; package major versions do not select a Plugin API family.
- `apiVersion` stays `"4.0"` for the stable API4 family. Set `compatibility.synergy` only when the plugin needs a newer additive host feature; otherwise the GA baseline is generated automatically.
- Stable API4 types and behavior remain backward compatible. Avoid `experimental.*` in published stable plugins because those surfaces may change or disappear.

## Contribution Factories

Executable factories: `operation`, `tool`, `hook`, `cliCommand`, `authProvider`, `lifecycleInstall`, `lifecycleUpgrade`, and `lifecycleUninstall`.

Declarative factories: `event`, `agent`, `skill`, `mcp`, `workbenchPanel`, `navigationItem`, `messageRenderer`, `composerAction`, `composerExtension`, `selectionExtension`, `textAction`, `messageSlot`, `settings`, `theme`, and `icon`.

The generated manifest contains declarations only. Runtime startup reports its actual handler IDs, and the host requires an exact match.

## Invocation Context

Every executable call receives a fresh `PluginInvocationContext` with request ID, Scope, optional Session, actor, cancellation, logger, scoped events, and only the Host Services allowed by approved capabilities. Plugins never receive a raw Synergy client, server URL, or token.

Capabilities govern Host Services; they do not claim to restrict direct OS access by the external process. `task.delegate` exposes `start/run/current/get/cancel`; `run()` waits for a native Cortex Task and returns its terminal snapshot, while `current()` reads the durable owner of the invoking child Session. Non-agent callers must provide an explicit parent Session/message for `start()` in the active Scope. Contributed Agents are registered in Synergy's native Agent registry. Set `hidden: true` for an owner-only Agent that must stay out of ordinary prompt and native-task exposure.

`asset.write` exposes `context.asset.create()` and returns a host-owned attachment. `shell.execute` exposes argv-only `context.shell.run()` through the ordinary permission and sandbox boundary. `cliCommand()` registers executable commands under `synergy <pluginId> <command>`. MCP contributions use strict shared local/remote schemas and are installed atomically under qualified `${pluginId}::${contributionId}` names.

`runtime.endpoint.read` exposes `context.runtimeEndpoint.get()`. It accepts no arguments and returns only the current loopback HTTP origin plus an opaque listener generation. It never returns a token, route, SDK client, or wider server configuration. Loopback and wildcard binds are served over loopback and return a normalized `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` URL; a bind that excludes loopback makes the service fail closed. External process management remains plugin-owned.

`task.delegate` is the plugin capability; `task` is the separate runtime permission evaluated by the current control profile. `task.start()` parent binding failures expose `PluginHostServiceErrorCode.TASK_PARENT_REQUIRED` or `TASK_PARENT_SCOPE_MISMATCH`. Host Service error codes survive process IPC.

`agent.call` exposes bounded Sessionless Agent work only to an executable contribution that lists it in `requires`. `context.agent.call()` waits for text; `context.agent.start()` returns a call ID immediately and reports its memory-only terminal result to the same plugin generation and Scope through `agent.call.after`. By default a plugin may call only a hidden Agent owned by its active generation; capability constraints may allow additional Agent names, permitted model roles, and lower host runtime/input/output ceilings. Calls may choose an allowed Synergy role but never a concrete provider/model ID. Neither path has tools, Session history, or Cortex lifecycle.

## Trusted UI

UI API 5 uses `PluginComponentProps<Context>` with one `context` property for every executable surface. The public service types cover environment/navigation, session collections and messages, draft/editor/submission, workbench resources, commands, overlays and lifetime. Specialized settings values, changes and save status live in `context.settings`. Import host components through `@ericsanchezok/synergy-plugin/components`, semantic icon types through `/icons`, formatting through `/format`, and Skin schemas through `/skin`.

```tsx
import type { PluginComponentProps } from "@ericsanchezok/synergy-plugin"
import { EmptyState } from "@ericsanchezok/synergy-plugin/components"

export default function Panel({ context }: PluginComponentProps) {
  return <EmptyState title={context.surface.id} description="Plugin content" />
}
```

Plugin Kit generates `artifacts.ui.apiVersion`, named exports and hashes for the full JS/CSS/font/image graph. The host shares Solid, scopes styles and portals, and disposes registrations by generation. UI 4 executable surfaces require a rebuild and migration; backend API4 compatibility remains independent. See [UI contributions](../../docs/plugins/ui-contributions.md) for services, Shells, Skins and real-host preview, and [UI 4 migration](../../docs/migrations/plugin-ui-4-to-5.md) for the breaking changes.

## Runtime and Data

External plugins run in one process per active `pluginId + version + generation`; enabled Scopes share it and receive separate invocation contexts. Trusted built-ins may use `inProcess`. The process boundary is crash/resource cleanup isolation, not an OS security sandbox.

The runtime transport protocol is host-owned. `runtime.protocolVersion` is diagnostic provenance, not a plugin feature gate or compatibility contract; use `apiVersion` and `compatibility.synergy` instead.

Plugins own their business data, schema, concurrency, backup, migration, and deletion. Synergy stores only installation metadata, approval, Scope enablement, declarative settings, and plugin credentials.

## Integrity Contract

`@ericsanchezok/synergy-plugin/integrity` owns the canonical manifest and permissions hash functions used by plugin-kit signing, marketplace metadata, installation verification, and approval records. The permissions hash binds capability constraints, contribution requirements, operation exposure, and trusted UI presence. Tooling and hosts must import this contract rather than reimplement its serialization or payload.

## Toolchain

```bash
synergy-plugin build
synergy-plugin validate --runtime-discovery
synergy-plugin test
synergy-plugin pack
synergy-plugin dev --server-url http://127.0.0.1:PORT
```

Live reload requires an explicit isolated `SYNERGY_HOME`. Successful rebuilds publish a new generation atomically; failed builds leave the previous generation active.

See [`docs/plugins`](../../docs/plugins/README.md) for architecture, lifecycle, marketplace, security, and UI guidance.
