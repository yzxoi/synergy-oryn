 * flaky even in a small shard execute in their own isolated processes. Both
 * the coverage runner (this file) and script/test-ci.ts consume the same

/**
 * Test files that fail even inside a small coverage shard. Each passes in
 * isolation; the failure modes are load- or state-sensitive:
 * - standalone Bun.build fixtures (embedding-standalone, svg-raster) hit
 *   "Unexpected reading file" on the transformers runtime under a full run;
 * - embedding and embedding-local drive the real transformers/ONNX runtime
 *   and exceed the run timeout under batch load (35s+), so they need their
 *   own process;
 * - nav-global-routes asserts home-scope completion counters that sibling
 *   files can mutate;
 * - openai-image-gen's global fetch mock races with sibling fetch mocks;
 * - auto-expand mocks 15 module functions and drives the real tool scheduler
 *   and session store, so a shared run with failing sibling fixtures (plugin
 *   registry, network) settles its parts as errors;
 * - host/managed-project-ownership/imap assert against global config and
 *   channel registries that a prior sibling's stale Config.current override
 *   or late rejection poisons (whole-file sub-millisecond failures on CI,
 *   2026-09-04), so they get their own process;
 * - experience-recall, experience-reencode, and database assert against the
 *   LibraryDB singleton that sibling library suites repopulate, clean, or
 *   leave stale handles across (intermittent zero-candidate, stale reopen
 *   returning an empty current job, and dimension-drift failures in shared
 *   batches);
 * - storage-retry spies global fs rename/unlink, storage-silent-not-found
 *   asserts metrics on a shared observability store, clarus-invite-accept
 *   reads shared channel/Clarus state, feishu-provider races SVG raster
 *   fallbacks, session-search scans live session stores under the shared
 *   home, and test-home-guard runs the subprocess contract around the
 *   real-home guard, so each also runs alone;
 * - holos/proxy/registry/retry/import/catalog/MCP-OAuth suites start
 *   local servers or assert network timing and flake under a full shared
 *   process on CI (see postmortem 0001 coverage failures); each passes in
 *   its own process.
 * - email/imap (mailparser parsing, config error propagation, IMAP truncation)
 *   and channel host / managed-project-ownership assert module-level email and
 *   channel state that sibling files can pollute under a full shared process;
 *   each passes in its own process (verified 2026-09-03 after repeated
 *   identical CI coverage failures on unrelated branches).
 * - library/database, library/experience-recall, channel/clarus-* and
 *   daemon/* suites assert module-level SQLite/vec, Clarus project, and
 *   managed-service env state that sibling files pollute under a full shared
 *   process; each passes in its own process (verified 2026-09-04 at pristine
 *   HEAD: the same shard-0 signature fails with or without the enforcement
 *   sandbox change set, and isolated reruns are green).
 * - test/cli/daemon-entry mock-modules src/server/runtime.ts; its own header
 *   documents that under the single-process coverage run the mock leaks into
 *   sibling files, and the startup assertion itself flakes under full-suite
 *   load on CI. Passes in its own process with coverage (verified 2026-09-04).
